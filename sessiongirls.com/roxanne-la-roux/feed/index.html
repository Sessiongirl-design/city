					<description><![CDATA[We met again in Philly on 5-12-24. Last time there might have been some doubt about how hard I was trying. Who the better wrestler is. Now we both know who that is and I can&#039;t deny it or offer any excuses. I gave it my best, but she is too much for me, and probably too much for you. And though she WILL beat you, don&#039;t be afraid. She won&#039;t hurt you but she we make sure you admit you can&#039;t beat her. It&#039;s not just her skill that makes it so much fun. Her personality and sexuality make it special. Roxanne has that special &quot;something&quot; that is hard to describe, but once you experience it, you will know what I am talking about. The only bad part of all this is that all other sessions just won&#039;t measure up. I guess I&#039;m going to have to session with the &quot;other&quot; girls till you come back to town. I can&#039;t wait.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I’m quite late writing this review, but I think everyone should know that Roxanne is a real treat to session with. Funny, charming, strong, dominant, and sooo beautiful it makes my head spin. Her physique is out of this world, and it was a real honor to worship her and experience her power over me. I still think about our brief time together and I can’t wait to see her again in Tampa if she returns. Thank you, Roxanne!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I had the privilege of meeting Roxanne for the first time July 8th when she came to Baltimore. She wrestled multiple men all day and still had plenty of stamina left for me. Truely amazing, I don&#039;t know how she did it. I know she wore me down in less then an hour. She had me submitting and knocked me out multiple times. (I&#039;m glad you didn&#039;t kill me with that pillow, lol). She was the 4th women I had a session with but was definitely the best. The difference being her sexuality and personality shown through to make it special. So worth the money, I had my hands full with her and it was so much fun. Roxanne: You need to hurry up and get a plane ticket to PA, I &#039;ll be here waiting....]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Just had my first session with Roxanne and will absolutely be booking her again!

She’s extremely thoughtful with her approach and loves what she does. She’s also fantastic with communication. I’d advise being concise but creative with what you are looking for out of your session. Roxanne will take the ball and run with it!

If you’re looking for a hardcore competitive match, there are plenty of other women to reach out to. But if you want your mat fantasies blended with healthy, playful intensity? I can’t imagine there is a better name in the game than Roxanne LaRoux.

She’s doing the lord’s work. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/2b50.png" alt="⭐" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/2b50.png" alt="⭐" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/2b50.png" alt="⭐" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/2b50.png" alt="⭐" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/2b50.png" alt="⭐" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I am a producer and I was referred to Roxanne by another very popular woman in the business. Immediately I seen why. But before I get into that I think it’s important to mention how down to earth and welcoming she is. She even helped me with a number of things even setting up the shoot that this review column probably couldn’t contain if I listed it all. Upon starting the shoot I was amazed at how her professionalism and unique style came alive. The first thing you’ll notice is how graceful she moves and how she uses her lean physique to her advantage. Her style is smooth and she seamlessly transitions from one move to the next using her flexibility with an almost snake like escapability and her legs are deceptively strong. She can easily play any role on camera but she really seemed to tap in to another side when she was in control and you can tell that she really enjoyed the work and leaves it all on the mat, she definitely does not cheat the audience for a millisecond. I am beyond grateful to have worked with her and will definitely be working with her again soon]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Wow what can I say? Easily one of the best sessions I’ve had in a while. Roxanne is a much of fun, joyful, playful, to sadistic, and badass when you’re with her. She makes you feel super comfortable and is such a joy to talk to. I loved every second of getting to know her and she was just as interested getting to know me, we talked a lot. I had a simple fantasy wrestling session with her and my goodness she delivered and more. She’s outrageous and incredibly flexible with her moves. She doesn’t have the biggest catalog of wrestling moves but I’m sure she’ll get there but what she has now easily makes up for it. She’s fun, attractive, and her energy is amazing. I rarely say this in my reviews but I’ll easily book her again, hungry for more. DO NOT MISS OUT ON THIS WOMAN!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[She is one of the few girls that I have had repeat sessions with and its clear once you meet her that you will find out why! She is drop dead gorgeous! Very fit and well spoken. She can talk to you about any number of things and keep a conversation going. And her scissors are to die for! I expected her to have some power behind her legs when I first sessioned with her but I did not at all expect her to have the power that she does! She also has the nicest booty I have ever seen as well. Being trapped in her reverse headscissors was not really being trapped at all, it was pure heaven! She can be a great wrestling match or she can be a terrific sensual session as well! She is just the total package and I would recommend her to anyone looking for a good session! One of the cleverest, most open, down to earth and gorgeous women I have ever had the pleasure of meeting!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;span&gt;I have been enjoying sessions with Roxanne since she came on the L.A. scene. She is reliable, intelligent,  easy to work with, and a lot of fun. She stays in great shape from her non-session training activities. Our wrestling is generally a light semi-competitive. She has good stamina, and does well despite no formal training. In recent meets we have switched things up with her “flow state” wrestling - a surprisingly energetic and tiring non-competitive improvisational wrestling play. Roxanne is highly recommended for those seeking a young smart fit session girl.&lt;/span&gt;]]></description>
