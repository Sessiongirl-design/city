					<description><![CDATA[I met Dallas online and started emailing her and just found her to be a friendly wonderful girl with a big heart. It is always challenging getting to know someone at first but I found there was mutual trust and respect in our friendship and when we got to wrestle each other, the mutual respect and friendship showed and we had some really exciting wrestling matches in oil, chocolate and mud. 

Dallas had me in her scissors hold in no time and even in the oil and mud, it was difficult to get out of her holds. She is strong and we had a very fun few matches where we were both exhausted and got to laugh and let off some steam together. I highly recommend Dallas to anyone. She is a great fighter and enjoys the sport of wrestling. 

She is also beautiful as well as strong and a very skilled Martial Artist. She is very skilled in wrestling and Brazilian Jiu Jitsu and someone that I can call a real friend. I was sad when she moved away to Miami but glad to see her back on SessionGirls and hope to meet up with her again in the ring or wrestling pit.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I know this review is a few months late and I apologize.   

I remember watching American Gladiators on Channel 5 in New York (Fox 5) around 1990 or 1991.  I didn&#039;t watch that many episodes but I always thought it waa a precursor to the Olympics.  The show was full of talent and had some real serious obstacles. My favorite challenge involved to see was the joust.
    I met Dallas in summer 2023 and she was the one who had that incredible and forever awe inspiring entrance on American Gladiators, doing a series of back flips upon her entry to kick start the show.
   Dallas is a true athlete all around.  I am serious when I say this.  We had about 10 catch wrestling bouts and she got me in submission every time.  She is in pristine shape.  And she is so special and unique.
   I know I have my mind already made up that I will see Dallas again when the opportunity presents itself.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I had the pleasure of having my first session with Dallas back in July when she visited Houston. Gentlemen, she is the real deal and just as stunning as she was back when she was on American Gladiators. 5&#039;9, 165 Lbs and probably the best natural athlete I&#039;ve ever sessioned with during my time. I can see why she got selected to be put on AG. Incredibly strong, she made me look real bad when we did arm wrestling and she defeated me all 3 times. Mind you, I&#039;m 6&#039;5, 260 Lbs so I&#039;m not exactly a lightweight. She also punches like a mule, having me hold a pillow to my stomach so she could give me a body shot and knocking me on my butt. Also highly skilled and trains in several martial arts including Boxing and BJJ. It was awesome getting to wrestle with her, in which I held my own but worked my hardest not to get humiliated and only tapped out once. But it was a grueling exercise for sure. Also got to talk with her about her time on AG and also her close chance of joining WWE during its apex in the Attitude Era. 

If you have the opportunity to session with her when she visits your city, please don&#039;t miss it. She can seem intimidating, but she&#039;s very sweet and accommodating, for instance she&#039;ll ask if you have any injuries or if there&#039;s any moves you don&#039;t want her to do on you. She&#039;s proof that you can be natural and still be incredibly strong. I look forward to seeing her again soon.

Don&#039;t miss out!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I recently had the pleasure  to session with dallas and I highly recommend her. She is deceptively strong and very skillful. After sessioning with over 20 women, I can honestly say she perform the strongest leg scissors I have encountered so far. I&#039;m 210 lbs and she was able to lift and carry me very easily.  She is an absolute beast to session with but has a very easy going personality. A beautiful woman in and out. I didn&#039;t  know before I sessioned with her but she is a former American gladiator, a former boxer and she will soon be inducted in the hall of fame soon. I don&#039;t remember if she told me for her boxing or martial arts.  She is legit and has credentials. If she comes to your city, do not miss the opportunity to meet her.]]></description>
