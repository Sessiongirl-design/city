					<description><![CDATA[Just did an exciting session with Cheyenne jewel.  She&#039;s a very skilled wrestler, we did some semi-competitive boxing in which I landed a few good shots on her, but she got me back when we did the wrestling, trapping me several times in a sleeper hold that I couldn&#039;t get out of.  She&#039;s one of the best, check her out when she comes to your city]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Shot with Cheyenne last weekend and it was a great shoot. We decided to book and then shot within a two-day period. She was prepared and move through transitions with ease.

Keep in mind, she was mainly in town for a music festival. Even so, she was ready to go for our morning shoot. She had some great ideas for fun scene that we put together on the spot and created a fun environment.

I knew she was a professional, I could tell that she was non-judgmental, but I was in awe with how solid she is. We&#039;ll definitely need to do some scenes to showcase her athleticism next time. 

I highly recommend her for shoots or sessions 100%.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I had the great honor of meeting Cheyenne Jewel this past weekend. As a long time fan I was not surprised that her reputation holds true. She is one tough woman and can hold her own against any man. I’m 6 feet tall and 240lbs and she had me completely beaten. Anytime I tried to regain myself she would get me with another move. Anytime she got me on my back or trapped in her thighs I was done for. We did competitive wrestling and I was determined to try to get at least one good pin/submission but it was a totally one sided fight that ended about 8-0. She learned my weaknesses quickly (getting distracted by her thighs and ass in chokes) and didn’t hesitate to exploit them to the fullest.

She claimed to be not in season but I disagree she was toned and incredibly fit. Honestly she looks as though she hasn’t aged a single day over 28. While I struggled with her on top of me she was absolutely beautiful flaunting and flexing her superior strength over me. The view of such a strong woman over me from underneath her in a schoolgirl pin was absolutely enticing. I could probably write an entire review about just how incredible her thighs were. They were strong and well built but felt so soft and comfortable around my neck and body as they squeezed the life out of me. Never before had I felt anything quite as wonderful and terrifying around my neck as Cheyennes thick thighs crushing me. After a few submissions of me tapping out right away I had to request that she dial back the pressure she initially applies so I could enjoy the drawn out agony and pleasure. Even though it was the end of her tour I made her sweat a bit from wrestling me and thats the closest thing to a win that I achieved in our session.

Most importantly I cannot emphasize how awesome of a person Cheyenne is. She is super down to Earth and friendly and felt like I was hanging out with an old friend when we talked. We had some great conversations while I rested when she had me trapped between her incredible thighs. She clearly loves what she does with a passion and puts her all into her sessions. She even taught me escapes and counter moves to holds when she saw I was struggling to break free of her holds. She was a great teacher as I picked up on them almost immediately.

If Cheyenne happens to visit your town or around you do yourself a favor and book with her. She is worth every penny if you like strong and beautiful woman kicking your ass! I will be seeing her again next time she’s in town!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This review is long over due.  I have sessioned with Cheyenne several times over the years in Las Vegas and in different parts of NJ/NY.  Make no mistake she is top shelf in everyway.  She is both strong and compassionate. There is no better sight than looking up from the floor and seeing Cheyenne with her foot on you in full victory pose.  Just amazing!!!!]]></description>
