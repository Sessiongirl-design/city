					<description><![CDATA[(This is going to be a long one since it’s so overdue, but TL;DR - her sessions are 10/10, she’s better looking than in her pictures, 3x tougher/stronger than you’d imagine and loves session wrestling! Don’t hesitate, book while she’s still around!!)

Anyways, Ive had two sessions with Queen Savage now. The last one was about 4 days ago and my neck is just now recovering <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f62d.png" alt="😭" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> however the pain was 100% worth it and I most definitely asked for it lol

One of my favorite things about her as a SG is she genuinely enjoys what she does! I’m pretty sure we accidentally went past our agreed time just because we were both having fun with our rolls <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f93c.png" alt="🤼" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> 

On top of that, I was telling her that she has one of the most ideal physique’s for knockouts(if that’s your thing). She’s pretty, slim, tough and deceptively fit <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f4aa-1f3fd.png" alt="💪🏽" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />  regardless of wether it’s with her legs or arms, once she clamps down your neck, her limbs feel like steel cables and you quickly realize that she decides your fate<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f608.png" alt="😈" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> all I’ll say is I told her prior to the session is I’m game for KO’s and she most definitely delivered because I lost count of the times she took me to lala land <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f634.png" alt="😴" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />  

Another big pro with her sessions is she loves roleplaying! For this recent session, we pretended that I was a wanted fugitive, hiding out somewhere and she was a loose cannon bounty hunter that didn’t hesitate to use excessive force on her bounties. I asked her to play that role, I asked her to treat me like her b!tch and aggressively subdue me. Mannnn…did she deliver <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f44c-1f3fd.png" alt="👌🏽" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f975.png" alt="🥵" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />  she fully understood the assignment 

P.S. I got lucky because we didn’t discuss this part in advance….but, after getting put to sleep in a RNC, she mentioned her friend was curious about mixed wrestling. 
So she asked if it’s cool if her friend watches, so I said sure. Her friend saw me get my ass handed to me by Queen Savage for a round or two till I got KO’d. Now, right before we finished, she decided to put on a show for our audience and really demonstrate her dominance over me! She got me in a camel clutch/RNC combo and demanded I say her name. (By now we were on a first name basis so I had just impulsively said her real name - wrong answer<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f643.png" alt="🙃" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />) She cranked the hold down tighter on me and I barely got to spit out “Queen Savage” before almost going out yet another time <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f602.png" alt="😂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />   I haven’t had that much fun in a session in a while]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I’ve drawn out this review for far too long about the Earth Diamond that is Queen Savage!

This will be a LONG FORM review because it deserves to be one. Yes, it will cover every base necessary. No, I don’t care about your attention span. If you have something else to do, then just do it. No seriously… Go On!


Okay, now that we got the jokers out the room let’s talk about someone truly special! Someone who commands your full attention just by her sheer presence. I have met some truly extraordinary ladies from across our nation of ours and even a couple of international superstars as well! Admittedly, a few stars have sparked my curiosity quite like the Queen. Only because there was limited content featuring her. However, I considered this a positive and not an indictment. I’ve started to follow her for a little while and thought maybe there will be an opportunity to travel to the ATL later this year to see you (Hey it a good excuse to travel as any other. LOL!). Which gives the perfect opportunity to give my flowers to the web development team of SessionGirls.com! They truly do an excellent job in updating this site daily! I am giving the team its Kudos because I believe they understand the magic of the “Refresh” button. I’m many of us have thought to ourselves, “man it would be awesome to have my favorite wrestler/this new wrestler that I’ve followed would stop by my city/state.” Suddenly you check the site, click on your state, you hit the “Refresh” button on your browser and then EUREKA! There she is and she is coming to your area and the cherry on top, she’s arriving at a time when you are available! Well at least that’s what has happened to me. I saw that Queen Savage was stopping by my city and I was available to meet her! As I said, ‘the Magic of the “Refresh” button.’ Thank you to the SG website team for allowing me to have the honor of gifting me with the ability to meet our star! 

When I saw that the Queen would be in town a week out from when she arrived, I made it a point to contact her. To my pleasant surprise, she responded to my inquiry immediately! We shared a few more emails communicating our mutual enthusiasm in meeting with each other. We were able to book within 24 hours. It was a breeze to book with her, she even dropped me her number so we can text when necessary. To say that her communication was up to par is an insulting understatement. This is what made it easier to send her a tribute deposit. As the days were leading closer to when we would meet, she ran into a slight impediment. The days she was in my area she was met with HIGH Demand! Apparently, I wasn’t the only one that desired to bow to the Queen! This led to a slight adjustment as we had to push our meeting back. Which, I didn’t mind at all. I refer to this situation as a good problem! So, we got to the day before we were to meet and she gave me a call, we talked for a good while just to finalize things. It was amazing to hear her sweet, soulful and yet sultry voice. I can easily tell she is from the South! So, we finalized all the details, we crossed the Ts and dotted the Is. Everything was set and ready to go! And then, another complication would emerge.

So, I’m an advent lover of Martial Arts! I’ve trained in Taekwondo, some Capoeira, I’ve even had a stint in Tai-Chi and Kung Fu. However, my main disciplines are in Judo, and Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. I train as adamantly as I can, even on days I don’t “feel” like training, or when my head is not all the way clear. At most times, the mat is my happy, it’s my passion, and at times it’s my therapy. Well, one day I went to train, and I knew that I wasn’t all the way there mentally. After class we had our open roll period in class. And I decided to choose one of the most dangerous opponents to roll (“wrestle”) with, a Big, Strong, White-Belt with little technical knowledge and no control. As I’m rolling with the young lad, I had my arm caught and isolated. He was trying to attempt a Kimura armlock submission. Which would have been fine, he does it properly, I tap, I keep rolling. He misses the opportunity to do the technique correctly and I seemingly escape. Or so I thought because he still has my arm and decides, “I gotta win!” and proceeds to twist and crank my arm into oblivion. “SNAP, CRACKLE, POP…!!” My elbow explodes and I no longer have a left arm. Now, it’s not broken but it’s non-functional. Now, why is narrative important, because my session with Queen Savage was the next day and I’ve already made up my mind that I was still going to make the appointment, even with One Arm!

Okay, now that I got that out the way I can get to more of what y’all want to know, Match Day! Well, I had to get there first and driving with extremely restricted use of one arm is no walk in the park. We had one more phone call before I arrived, and she gave me her lodging info. Once I arrived, I was greeted with some fine Southern Hospitality! A bright smile, a warm hug, a good story about her travels, etc. Then she noticed and immediately, “OMG, what happened to your arm!” I had to give her the story of how that creaking, old man was trying to hang with a young buck. I crossed that bridge and now I must pay the toll. She didn’t down upon me or pity me. She just looked upon me with caring, bright, attentive eyes and just told me to have a seat while she looked at my elbow and my arm. Now, it’s great for a session host to care about your injury. However, to be cared for by a Registered Nurse (RN) and gain a professional opinion by a medical practitioner. It was at THIS moment I made the right decision to book Queen Savage! She spent time caring for my injury and gave me advice that has accelerated the healing process to this very day! Incredible, simply incredible! And even with all the TLC I was given; she still was ready to bring the pain! As the saying goes, “In for a penny, in for a pound(ing).” I was definitely given my money’s worth!

We booked a Competitive Session, and I brought mats ready to go for a rumble. But seeing the condition of my arm we’ve decided to have a rain check for the next time! We rather enjoyed a fun Non-Competitive tussle. I’ll cut to the chase, to underestimate this Southern Belle with intoxicating attractiveness and a lean frame would be a critical if not nearly lethal error. Queen Savage has it ALL! Strength, Speed, Flexibility, Coordination, Savy, Moxy, and a True Warrior Spirit. If you look at her and ask yourself, “Can she fight for real?” Well, I can confirm to you that as someone who was raised with Twelve (12) Brothers, you read that right 12 BROTHERS! The answer is Yes she can FIGHT for real! Her head scissors have KO ability, Her Body Scissors has still left me with a receipt weeks after our session. There was even a time that she lifted all 170+ Lbs. of me off the ground with No Leverage Point, just PURE MUSCLE! I wasn’t surprised but still puzzled at how so a strong and powerful body can be attached to such a beautiful woman with a seemingly sylvite frame. Well, she is a former gymnast, and I did say that she’s from the South; from Arkansas to be exact. I can attest to you that there is something different in that water!  We had quite a fun and hilarious roll around as the Queen allowed a gimpy old man to wrestle her with one arm looking all types of goofy. Yet she didn’t spend any time laughing at me, not for one second. She accommodated my injury and customized the session to what would provide the best time for the both of us. We spent our time laughing with each other. But, on the record I had to tap to her Body Scissor three different times. LOL! So, she can even bet someone who’s trained too! She would be a worthy and formidable rival even if I had two arms. However, I took this “L” with a smile on my face! I couldn’t even think about the loss because of how much fun I had and how many laughs we shared. Ahh… what a night!! 

Well, time to land my plane. The hardest part of our time was of course the departure. As most wrestlers have probably figured out by now, I SUCK at Goodbyes! This time would be no different because I tanked it on this goodbye too. The unfortunate and utter tragedy is conclusion of all good things is the end of them. Fortunately, she didn’t rush me out the door, we were able to bond and laugh on my way out. As I got into my car with utter amazement of the night and imagining the absolute regret in canceling due to “injury.” If you need a reminder, DON’T CANCEL! Every session has brought a unique flavor and left an inimitable impression. This occasion would prove no different in the best way possible! If you’ve gotten this far in this read, you should know that “She comes with my highest recommendation!” is simply an offence to your intelligence. If you’re pondering, “should I book her?” Do yourself and even more importantly QS a favor… STOP! Unless you want a “Congratulations” for playing yourself! Especially if you desire a first-class experience of when ‘Gorgeous can whoop your @$$!’ One thing for sure, two things for certain even on sample of Queen Savage will leave you stuck! As the saying goes, “once bitten, FOREVER Smitten.” So, if you’re in the Black Mecca of Atlanta, Georgia or if you’re lucky enough to have this Fort Smith, Arkansas native grace your town go ahead and send a buzz to Queen Savage. I can’t wait for my next opportunity! Now all there’s left is to book and prepare to BOW!]]></description>

The answer is Yes she can FIGHT for real! Her head scissors have KO ability, Her Body Scissors has still left me with a receipt weeks after our session. There was even a time that she lifted all 170+ Lbs. of me off the ground with No Leverage Point, just PURE MUSCLE! I wasn’t surprised but still puzzled at how so a strong and powerful body can be attached to such a beautiful woman with a seemingly sylvite frame. Well, she is a former gymnast, and I did say that she’s from the South; from Arkansas to be exact. I can attest to you that there is something different in that water!  We had quite a fun and hilarious roll around as the Queen allowed a gimpy old man to wrestle her with one arm looking all types of goofy. Yet she didn’t spend any time laughing at me, not for one second. She accommodated my injury and customized the session to what would provide the best time for the both of us. We spent our time laughing with each other. But, on the record I had to tap to her Body Scissor three different times. LOL! So, she can even bet someone who’s trained too! She would be a worthy and formidable rival even if I had two arms. However, I took this “L” with a smile on my face! I couldn’t even think about the loss because of how much fun I had and how many laughs we shared. Ahh… what a night!! </p>
<p>Well, time to land my plane. The hardest part of our time was of course the departure. As most wrestlers have probably figured out by now, I SUCK at Goodbyes! This time would be no different because I tanked it on this goodbye too. The unfortunate and utter tragedy is conclusion of all good things is the end of them. Fortunately, she didn’t rush me out the door, we were able to bond and laugh on my way out. As I got into my car with utter amazement of the night and imagining the absolute regret in canceling due to “injury.” If you need a reminder, DON’T CANCEL! Every session has brought a unique flavor and left an inimitable impression. This occasion would prove no different in the best way possible! If you’ve gotten this far in this read, you should know that “She comes with my highest recommendation!” is simply an offence to your intelligence. If you’re pondering, “should I book her?” Do yourself and even more importantly QS a favor… STOP! Unless you want a “Congratulations” for playing yourself! Especially if you desire a first-class experience of when ‘Gorgeous can whoop your @$$!’ One thing for sure, two things for certain even on sample of Queen Savage will leave you stuck! As the saying goes, “once bitten, FOREVER Smitten.” So, if you’re in the Black Mecca of Atlanta, Georgia or if you’re lucky enough to have this Fort Smith, Arkansas native grace your town go ahead and send a buzz to Queen Savage. I can’t wait for my next opportunity! Now all there’s left is to book and prepare to BOW!</p>

					<description><![CDATA[I met the beautiful Queen Savage while she was in Houston. She had been on my &quot;wishlist&quot; for people to session with for a while. I had a two hour boxing session with her. The session was the best I could ask for. She&#039;s super friendly, down to earth, and enjoys what she does and is tough. She is way more beautiful in person. If she is in your neck of the woods, do yourself a favor and see this special lady.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Recently had a competitive wrestling session with Queen Savage and it went amazing. She had great communication and setting up the match was a breeze. I had a significant size advance but Queen held her own and we had a back and forth match. 

Highly recommend!]]></description>

November of 2021...I apologize for you not getting a response. I had a very very close death hit November 7th that pretty much took me away from sessions for a while until now. I am just getting back to doing tours. Your more than welcome to email me and set something up/follow my travels as well and see if I come to a city near you.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Definitely the complete package: Skilled, fast, all muscle,, tough 
 as nails and loves to wrestle bigger guys. She&#039;s down to about 130 but I&#039;m a strong 165 and she just toyed with me. Great trash talker. Her favorite trick is getting the guy in a head scissors and taunting him as she slowly increases the pressure until he can&#039;t take it any more.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I agree with dj5656 and boxingguy. I emailed her back in November of 2021 when I was going to Miami, FL (ahead of my trip) which my actual arrival in Miami coincided with her visit to Miami. She was actually traveling with another lady for sessions and she never got back to me so I found someone else on this website for a session in Miami but Queen Savage was my primary choice. Oh well]]></description>
