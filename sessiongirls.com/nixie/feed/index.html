					<description><![CDATA[Had a session with this ferocious beauty in Manchester a few days ago. I’ve had quite a few sessions with Nixie over the past few years and one thing noticeable is how she’s grown over that    time. She’s now packing some serious muscle on her upper body to match the power of her legs. 
We had a 2 hour competitive session. I don’t know what the final score was but it was somewhere close to 30-0. I’d say her triangles and armbars or her speciality. I couldn’t escape her guard at all and ended up getting triangle choked every time and whenever she had me mounted I couldn’t budge her at all, her legs were just too damn strong. It seems she has turned herself into a powerful, sexy little unit. 
Can’t wait to do it again. She puts a massive smile on my face every time we’ve met for a session. She always comes across as a very happy go lucky person who always brings a positive mood but is a real beast on the mats with an array of skills and shocking power for a woman of her size.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Nixie is an absolute delight! I met her during her visit to the San Francisco Bay Area. Setting up the session via email was a breeze. We agreed on a semi-competitive submission match and she overwhelmed me with her superb skills. Even though I had a considerable weight advantage, she was able to submit me 12 times in a row while I was lucky to have gotten side control once. Equally as enjoyable as her owning me on the mats were the conversations we had during the breaks in action. I intend on booking her any time she&#039;s nearby on a tour or if I ever make a visit to England.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I met Nixie earlier this month in London for a competitive wrestling session that really ended up being more semi-competitive just because of how good she was at getting submissions -- it really wasn&#039;t much of a match! I&#039;m probably a good 60lbs + heavier than her and 5 inches taller but she was so skilled and strong (her body is well toned and she has strength in every direction, both lower and upper body) and moves quickly on the mats. She is one of the nicest people as well and very easy to converse with, and I had an absolute wonderful time. Hoping to see her again soon!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I rarely meet new girls - after many years of experience I have my favourites - however, something struck me about Nixie and I met her in New York this week on a flying visit (for her).  What a breath of fresh air.  She is everything she details here and more.  An incredibly lively, positive and cheery personality combined with an properly trained and athletic body.  She has remarkable strength and a very fast developing fighting style.  You will not submit or pin her easily and she will laugh beautifully as she submits you !
Nixie was accommodating of my ideas for the session and we easily agreed limits on both sides.
My hesitation on meeting new girls is that is is often difficult to find the &quot;real deal&quot;.  Nixie is it, no question.]]></description>
