					<description><![CDATA[I met Rage for the second time a few days ago. I had high expectations  since my first session with her was one of my favourites but she met all of my expectations,
During the session there wasn&#039;t much I could do to stop her from using me as a squeezing toy or a sitting place, and she was very clear about that.
Rage is strong, knows what to do on the mats, her scissors are deadly and her trash-talking game is top tier.
If you have the chance you should definitely meet her, you won&#039;t be disappointed.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I realised I hadn’t left a review for you Rage so here it is :)
I met Rage in Berlin November 2023. I was on a weekend away with my friends and wanted to session with Rage (and Uzi) while there. The first hour was with Rage, then Uzi joined in for 30 mins double session and then i completed a final hour with Uzi. 
Rage was amazingly friendly but also dominant when crushing me. We had a little hiccup at the beginning as the venue she hired didn’t have a key and so she kindly found an alternative place. I didn’t have any plans later so timing wasn’t an issue and we just started the session later than planned. 
Rage has to be one of the (if not THE) strongest scissor girls out there. My god her thighs engulfed my head and body. I think she had me begging for mercy at 30/40% power. I have since bulked up and am a lot stronger so hopefully if you visit England this year, then I could see if I can handle 50% haha? Also I wanna let you KO me as last time I was a bit nervous for that being my first time. 
Overall I’d highly recommend Rage, as it will be one of the best experiences of ur life :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I met Rage during her visit to Brussels a few weeks ago. This girl is first of all very rigorous in terms of organization. Everything is clear, and she asks the necessary questions so that there are no misunderstandings.

During the session, she is a formidable fighter who shows no mercy. She will satisfy you if you are looking for sensations and relentless fights where you like to suffer.

Don&#039;t expect to be spared and have a « relax » session : you&#039;ll have to fight if you want to survive... or else you&#039;ll be completely dominated and humiliated during the match ! So she will suit you perfectly if that’s what you like.

But when the match is over, Rage becomes the way she was before getting on the mats : an adorable person with whom we take great pleasure in chatting!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I met Rage for a boxing and wrestling session. It was only my second session, so I&#039;m not use to it yet and I&#039;m quite a shy guy but she was very welcoming and I felt immediately at ease with her. She&#039;s really easy to talk and friendly.
Communication before the session was very clear and she responds quickly.

The session. We started with boxing, just two rounds. She&#039;s a slugger, so it was fun but it&#039;s better not to get hit ! I lost my hair band and I boxed literally blind in the second round, it was messy and she cheated with throws, then punching me on the floor. No referee there, so I guess it was legal haha, and I was in no position to contradict her !
Without a break we – she – switched to wrestling and, well, it was a total domination for the rest of the session. She didn&#039;t give me a single break, using me like a toy, squeezing me, sitting on me, smothering me, all that very enjoying and painful stuff, you know. I&#039;m not a good wrestler but I don&#039;t think her skills should be doubted. In fact, I tend to think she went gently. Also, I asked for sweaty domination and I received sweat, a lot of sweat.
She broke me in pieces but I had a fun moment. She was joyful and laughing when she humiliated me, adding another layer to the humiliation.

Despite my inexperience, I highly recommand her to everyone, wrestlers and feet lovers (hehe).
Thank you again for being amazing.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I just had my very first session ever with Rage and I have to say that this was a thousand time better than what I expecting. 
She is an amazing person, she&#039;s very welcoming and really sweet. I would recommend her to everyone, especially if you&#039;re looking for someone to take away your session wrestling virginity. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> 

I booked a competitive session with her, I&#039;m untrained, so I knew I would lose but I was confident that I would at least be a challenge to her and deliver a honorable fight. 

Well, that didn&#039;t go as planned..., she handled me like a toy and broke my confidence in a matter of seconds.
That competitive session quickly turned into a domination session. She simply spent her time putting me in various holds, bullying me and humiliating me. 

At one point she just pinned me down and started a tickling torture, I literally screamed for help <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f605.png" alt="😅" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> 

Her scissors made me beg for a break every single minute !! 
Sometimes she&#039;ll grant it; however, her definition of a break is that she&#039;ll sit on you like an object and watch you gasp for air.
You just have to accept it and be thankful she&#039;s not squeezing your neck like a Boa constrictor <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f604.png" alt="😄" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
She&#039;s truly sadistic, but I guess that&#039;s what make us all fall in love with her haha.  

She was genuinely enjoying torturing and humiliating me, which was definitely delightful even though I was in so much pain. 
I lost my dignity on that day, but at least I made her laugh and have fun, so I&#039;ll consider that a win <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f601.png" alt="😁" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> 

In conclusion, Rage is truly amazing both as a person and as a wrestler, her sessions are wonderful and I&#039;ll definitely recommend her to everyone. If she ever comes to your city, then don&#039;t miss the chance to meet her.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[A few days ago I had a session with Rage in Berlin.

I had previously contacted her by e-mail.
She is already very friendly and we were able to arrange a time. 
Quickly, easily and without any problems. 
And of course clarify what should happen.

As I&#039;m not familiar with the trade, I naturally didn&#039;t want to get involved in a shootout with a club in my hand.
I&#039;m practically untrained anyway and also 25 kg heavier than her.
So let her simply present me with her repertoire.
I should get what I want.
Rage appeared on time.

So I had barely signaled my arrival at the location,
when she was already there, like a genie in a bottle.

We greeted each other warmly and in a good mood,
and I&#039;m sure we were both glad that everything had gone so smoothly.

She really is a lovely person who you immediately take to your heart.
She stays that way until she closes your eyes.
Honestly, very charming until you&#039;re on the mats with her.

It should also be noted, that she is well prepared and seems to leave nothing to chance.
The dance was about to start.

From the very first second, I needed my maximum to at least 
to be able to act minimally.
It was less than a warm-up for her.

Consequently, it didn&#039;t take very long before I ran out of breath.
As soon as she had me under control, the first of her scissors followed immediately.
Which then hit me so hard that I could hardly do anything for the rest of the time,
I could hardly do anything for the rest of the time.
From this point on, I was just her toy and she could do whatever she wanted with me.
Handle after handle followed incredibly quickly.
I literally realised that this could only end in one of your bitter sweet scissors.
So I desperately tried to at least delay it, but there was no chance.

When ever I was unable to move, she simply pulled me across the mat,
in high spirits like a girl does with a big teddy bear.

She was in a great mood and you could see exactly how much fun it was for her,
to turn a man into her toy that squeaks when she squeeze it.
So I had to ask for short breaks at ever shorter intervals, which she granted.
In short, she slaughtered me and hardly had to make any real effort.

So you should think carefully beforehand about what you agree with her, because you can rely on her to deliver,
that she will deliver.

10 out of 10 points to you Rage, it was nice, even with your painful locks and scissors. 
You are my very first recommendation if somenody have an itchy coat :-)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I booked a session with Rage last year when she was in the UK, we had a competitive session, I was a lot bigger than her and strength train, so I was fairly confident. Rage’s technique was flawless and after 5 minutes she’d won and the match was already over, the rest of the match consisted of her just keep me in reverse head scissors and sitting on me and not letting me get back up, making me tap time after time and I just couldn’t get up, all my energy had just been squeezed out of me! Rage kept me in reverse scissors and wouldn’t let me go, she then said I had to say ‘please rage’ instead of tap and I had no choice as it was either that or be knocked out! Proud of her victory, Rage posted about it on Twitter.

Be warned her head scissors are lethal!

We’ve had 3 sessions in total now, thank you Ollie :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello everyone  !
First of all a big compliment to Rage Shieldmaiden. I love her way of conducting her dominating sessions. On the mat, Rage is incredibly good.
 Best of all, she got even better with every new encounter, of course I never really stood a chance against Rage, which isn&#039;t bad at all. It never gets boring, just type and forget. You will suffer, you must like it. Rage is technically well trained, mega leg scissors (I love them), strong grips and and and...! A great experience for me every time. Certainly one of the best on the session scene. Highly recommend to anyone who has the opportunity and always love to come back. Thank you Henry xx]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Really, really a wrestler out of category.  I must have close to twenty thirty sessions now under my belt including 2 with Rage

Technically it&#039;s just amazing.  physically she is phenomenally powerful.  A pleasure to fight with her.  If you are looking for a challenge expect to be served but certainly not to be the winner.

Personally, I found the wrestler who fully meets my expectations during a session.  Technique, power, capable of exhausting me and making me completely docile, all while keeping a smile of joy and a pure pleasure to fight with her.  Truly an INCREDIBLE wrestler in every sense of the word.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Rage, thank you so much for my custom!!!  Firstly and most importantly, it came out even better than I was even hoping for.  I asked for a pretty extreme ballbusting beatdown and you absolutely nailed it and threw in some extra jaw-dropping punishments for the pour soul that I hadn&#039;t even thought of or seen on camera before!  I&#039;ve seen a lot of beatdown videos over the years, and this one is right up there with the most brutal.  It&#039;s a true testament to your &quot;slight&quot; sadistic streak and creativity!  

To anyone considering ordering a custom, I found the entire process to be a pleasure.  Rage&#039;s personality really shines through even in simple email correspondence.  She was incredibly transparent on when filming would be possible and what type of jobber she was trying to recruit for the clip... not everyone can handle full-on ballbusting.  I found this to be so refreshing as not everyone in the industry is as communicative.  

I would absolutely recommend booking a custom video through Rage, it&#039;ll be a jewel in your collection!]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Rage, thank you so much for my custom!!!  Firstly and most importantly, it came out even better than I was even hoping for.  I asked for a pretty extreme ballbusting beatdown and you absolutely nailed it and threw in some extra jaw-dropping punishments for the pour soul that I hadn&#8217;t even thought of or seen on camera before!  I&#8217;ve seen a lot of beatdown videos over the years, and this one is right up there with the most brutal.  It&#8217;s a true testament to your &#8220;slight&#8221; sadistic streak and creativity!  </p>

					<description><![CDATA[I was due to session with Rage in the UK last week but unfortunately got struck down with Covid and had to cancel.

Instead I ordered 2 customs. I&#039;ve received them today after only a few days wait from filming - very impressive!

They are of the highest quality and I LOVE them.

Communication from Rage re both the doomed session and the custom orders was first class - she was not only very efficient and prompt, but also a lot of fun in her communications and her personality really comes across in her emails.

I have previously sessioned Rage a few years ago in London, and I remember that session being out of this world good. She dominated me from start to finish in a sweaty fun affair, and had me sparked out between her thighs and squished against her gorgeous derriere. She was brilliant, which is why I&#039;m gutted to miss out this time.

I will 100% session with her again, but glad I did manage to get some customs in. If you&#039;re unable to session, then I HIGHLY recommend you get in touch with her about customs. Follow her twitter for filming dates etc.

Rage is awesome.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I met Rage yesterday while she toured in London, and I have to say, it was one of the most fantastic times I ever had.
I was fully new to the scene but she made the process so easy, letting me understand what I was getting into, as well as extremely friendly and open.
Once I was there though, the session was wild! It was clear she was toying with me, her strength is so understated.
From powerful scissors to other inescapable holds, at times I feared I&#039;d give in, only for her to switch the hold/sit on me and berate me for being weak over and over!

I&#039;m feeling the pain this morning as it was a full body work out, but it was the most amazing experience, and I can&#039;t wait for her to tour here again!

Would most definitely recommend to anyone who&#039;s interested as Rage will give you that work!

					<description><![CDATA[I met the amazing Rage for a session in London this evening. I was a fan of her work on Fight Pulse, and when I initially reached out to her, she responded immediately with a cheery manner and got the ball rolling quickly. I asked her for a fantasy session, and she said that she&#039;d enjoy that. Well, Rage is one of the strongest women I&#039;ve ever met. You can never really tell someones full strength by what you see online, but in person, I felt her power big time!

For the entire duration, she sat on me in various positions and I genuinely couldn&#039;t escape her holds. I tapped out numerous times, often fearful what she had in store for me next. She appeared to take great delight in torturing and humiliating me, which is of course what I signed up for :)  

A truly memorable session, it was a real honour to meet Rage and experience how skilled a wrestler she is, even though she hardly exerted any effort whilst pinning me. A beautiful, friendly girl, when she&#039;s next in your neighbourhood, be sure to look her up.

Thank you, Rage :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I had the pleasure of meeting Rage for the first time on 24/06 in Paris. It was recommended to me is honestly I am not disappointed, even I am absolutely delighted.

Most sincerely book with her if you have the chance, she is smiling, welcoming, puts you at ease directly if in addition it is your first time with her.

By cons once on the mat..... I had already seen it on video so even being &quot;prepared&quot; psychologically, it deploys a lot of strength.His technical background is also very developed which makes it a combo that few wrestlers can boast of having it at his level. (armbar , scissors , lot of keys and struggling.) She passes all the holds that she wanted quite easily, very honestly.

 It’s really a great time, to do with her as well in semi-competitive as I did for other guys I think about in person.And for my part, if I were to recommend one to you, it would be her.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I booked today in Zurich Rage for 2 hours. First things first: I survived. I have to say that I&#039;m actually not a wimp, but what I experienced today was uniquely beautiful but also very painful. I was hoping to fight 30 minutes with honor. I knew my condition is not very good. But I took my chances. After 2 hours I didn&#039;t do anything, I was brought up and bullied. Physically, verbally.. I screamed like a moose. Not as pleased as when mating. More of a shot moose. If she made me scream Many (desired) handsmothers often left me mute. Conclusion; fight the bull when you are 100 percent fit and lose with honor instead of losing unfit dishonorably. But I will do it again!

					<description><![CDATA[I recently had a session with Rage in the UK after finding out she was visiting for a short while it seemed like the perfect opportunity to set something up.

Rage was really responsive to emails from the get-go and would always reply back in thorough detail so I knew exactly what to expect from the session.

I&#039;d had around 4-5 sessions before, all within the last year or so so wasn&#039;t exactly a newbie but at the same time didn&#039;t have a vast amount of experience either.

We spent a bit of time chatting about our lives and what interests both of us about the wrestling side of things. It was really interesting to hear about all the countries Rage has travelled to session and do shoots and you could tell straight away it&#039;s always been a huge passion of hers.

I explained what got me into mixed wrestling and wasn&#039;t judged which I loved, in fact she said she&#039;d heard it many times before so I felt at ease talking about pretty much everything in finer detail about what I wanted the session to include, and maybe not include! (haha)

Her scissors were lethal! I believe I got KO&#039;d twice, and after the second time was starting to feel light headed, but strangely in a euphoric way. I asked Rage to ease of slightly but it didn&#039;t seem to stop her, she just loves what she does so much!

Rage accommodated any holds/scissors I preferred and executed them in great style, though after around 50 minutes I was kind of hoping the session was coming to an end, not because I wanted to leave, but because I don&#039;t think I could take much more of the beatdown!

I&#039;m glad I got the session filmed, I like to keep filmed sessions as a sort of keepsake to remind me just how deadly these girls are!

I would definitely hope to see Rage around again, especially when she&#039;s back in the UK and would of course recommend her to anyone feeling a little sceptical or unsure of booking a session, take your chance whilst you can! x]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I had an incredible session with Rage.
Communication setting up the session was great.

Firstly, she is stunning. There were some moments when the view was worth the pain.
Secondly, she is far, far stronger than I expected. I have had sessions before, and she genuinely had me panicking the whole way through.

She balances her playful and sadistic side perfectly. Every move she does, even holding you in position by sitting on your neck can either cause pain or at best, be very uncomfortable. She used some ropes to tie my hands and feet which made me more helpless than I already was. Which also was thoroughly enjoyable being at her mercy.

Her trash talk is great and she seems to really enjoy the session, which makes it even better.

I genuinely couldnt take any more headscissors after 90mins. Had a quick chat with her before and after and she is genuinely a lovely person. Though you might not think so during the session!

I would highly recommend Rage and will definitely session with her again. Though underestimate her at your peril!]]></description>
