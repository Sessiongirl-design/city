					<description><![CDATA[Where We Go... Another Long Review... This is your opportunity to scroll to the last paragraph and be on your way!

Okay you&#039;re still here. Well, good because the account that I share with you is my honest report of my experience of with the INCREDIBLE Kim Chi! I&#039;ll be as tempered as I can, but I won&#039;t be tight-lipped. Alright let&#039;s get this going and let&#039;s see where to begin. I guess at the... Beginning. LOL!

Unbeknownst to our Star, I&#039;ve been following her for a while. Now before I sound stalker-ish, please allow me to explain. When I first dipped my toe into this world, I was planning to have my first session with another lovely lady, but she couldn’t make it to my area at the time. However, KimChi was and as I looked her up, I saw that she had an illustrious career portfolio! I was looking forward to booking her but unfortunately, I had an emergency to handle while she was in my city. Now fast forward another year and my schedule became a lot freer and clearer. Once I discovered that she would be in my city again and I jumped at the opportunity to contact her!

I sent my initial contact email about Five (5) Days before her scheduled date to meet. For my standards at least this was short notice. She answers back in 14 MINUTES! I had to check back with you all later to see if that&#039;s a PR (personal record) for response time! I was astonished! We shared a couple more emails including an offer for a double session with another extraordinary young lady that I unfortunately declined. It still pains me to this day. (But from that pain I learnt a valuable lesson in being prepared for doubles from this point forward!). I digress, still amazed at the ease and SPEED of communication! This made my decision to send my deposit much easier. The total time from initial email to booking was 30 Minutes! Ms. Kim may have the record for fastest booking! Yeah, she doesn’t play those games (shout out to Jersey Girls, LOL!)! A consummate professional down to the very syllable of that term. Now that I have boasted about her professionalism let’s get down to &quot;THE MAIN EVENT of the Morning!&quot; Yep... Match Day!

When I parked and was able to enter the building, I was greeted with a gigawatt smile and one of the most Boa Constrictor-like hugs I&#039;ve experienced lately. I loved it! I can see that this was going to be an exceptional time! We began to converse with her apologizing for the tightness of the hug. She exclaims, &quot;I&#039;m a Hugger!&quot; Which I was perfectly fine with as a Hugger myself. However, I could help but sense that there was some strategy involved as well. A crafty way to disguise her intentions to &quot;Size Me Up!&quot; as it were. She&#039;ll correct me otherwise. As we continued to converse, I had to apologize that I didn&#039;t come as groomed as needed to be and asked her permission for a quick shower. It was granted without repudiation. I appreciated her kindness! So, after cleaning myself from the work grind and smelling the lovely aroma of her partner in session&#039;s cooking (I&#039;m still dreaming about those pancakes!) We were able to get down to the business end of our meeting! 

Now I&#039;ve booked this session for a Semi-Competitive Match. I typically take heed to the &quot;Services Offered&quot; tab and comply accordingly. I&#039;m one to look for specifically look for &quot;Competitive&quot; or &quot;Semi-Competitive&quot; Wrestling so that I avoid unnecessary questions. During the session though, I typically love to free flow and adjust accordingly! I prefer my host to express herself freely! Now even in a fully Competitive situation I&#039;ve NEVER underestimated ANY Ladies that I&#039;ve booked. I learned to be ready for ANYTHING! All this to say that Ms. KimChi while she is a gorgeous, captivating sweetheart off the mat. On the mat, as many have discovered, your girl is a True Warrior! An Absolute Beast with a motor that&#039;s all torque and rev! Simply put, the &quot;Semi-&quot; nature of our session was all but omitted. In the best way possible. LOL! A lot of our scrambles were reminiscent of old school cartoon dust-up scrums. LOL! Our jostles were action-packed. The only thing that I had to keep up with her energy was my technique and training. Submissions were shared on BOTH sides.  I can&#039;t give you exact details upon setups or specific methods used because it was all just a Blur. I can give you certain submissions used that gave us our breaks. Americana, Head &#038; Arm Triangle and RNC were connected by yours truly. KimChi obtained it in an RNC of her own. Now while I may have scored more submissions (3-1) I didn&#039;t end our squabble. Our superstar connected with what would prove to be the KO Blow so to speak. LMBO (Book her for further details.)! We ended up just laughing and cracking jokes after we finished (mostly by her. Ha!). As we both laid our sweat-drenched, exasperated bodies on the mat for a moment to catch our collective breath she had the where with all to ask a special inquiry, &quot;How did you enjoy your experience?&quot; I only had enough energy to repeatedly gasp aloud one word, &#039;AMAZING!&#039; And that&#039;s how we concluded how time! 

After I collected the heap the was my carcass, and I bowed to our gracious host. I was allowed a few minutes to freshen up and quickly change. We exchanged more laughs and hugs! I told her that &#039;I&#039;m the absolute WORST at Goodbyes!&#039; So, she aptly states, &quot;Well, then I&#039;ll implement my Inner-Jersey Girl. Here&#039;s one more hug, now... GET OUT!&quot; As she exclaims with her gigawatt smile! I collected my stuff and complied with her orders. One last hug and I was out the door. Phew! What a time huh?! Now, I said that this session was unique. I&#039;ve had plenty of hearty and competitive sessions. But on woman before (and no woman since) has worn me out the point where I laid my creaky old body down in the hatch of my SUV for an hour nap! Yeah, it was that real! That is the one-of-a-kind satisfaction that Ms. KimChi has given me! I hope that she provides half the satisfaction for you as you send in your booking request. Yes, YOU! If you made it this far into this review you mind as well go ahead and send that email and ready that deposit now! If I must say it, &#039;Yes! KimChi has my HIGHEST Recommendation.&quot; There you have it! I hope that helps you further make up your already made-up mind. A final piece of advice, if you decide to book her &quot;Semi-Competitively&quot; and think you&#039;re gonna get an &quot;Easy Win.&quot; Underestimate this Jersey Jubilee at your own peril!  You&#039;ll be grinded into dust to be blown away like chaff and BEG for more of this treatment to complete exhaustion. You&#039;ve been duly warned. 

Our superstar during our match exclaimed, &quot;We MUST have a REMATCH!&quot; A request that I hope to grant sooner than later. Thank you, KimChi! While you are in fact, &#039;AMAZING!&#039; Now that I have time to catch my breath I can also say, &#039;you&#039;re truly a phenomenal woman, phenomenally!&quot; Until we cross paths again in my native DMW, your native NJ, your residence NC or anywhere in between I wish you Peace, Much Love and Blessings! And huh... go a little easier on me next time... SIKE! XD]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I had another awesome session with Kim Chi today! She is sweet, inviting, and really puts you at ease. Her tattooed body looks and feels nice. She is wonderful with her touch and her fingernails. She greatly enjoys having her belly button worshipped. Book her for a great time!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I had a semi-comp match with Kim Chi last night and she absolutely took my breath away, in more ways than one. First of all, she was extremely professional, so setting up the session was a breeze. She was punctual, showing up on time and looking lovely and intimidating. Once she put on the bikini I was mesmerized by how strong yet feminine she looked. As far as her attitude, she was both mean (as requested) and energetic. 

I can&#039;t begin to tell you how aggressive and intimidating she was. Both her arms and legs were much stronger than I anticipated, and she tossed me around like a rag doll and twisted me like a pretzel. When she had me in a schoolgirl pin, I was frozen with helplessness as she looked me in the eyes and bombarded me with verbal humiliation. Throughout the match she got me into so many moves and so many humiliating positions that I almost feel like I could have fainted from the excitement because she was so brutal yet sensual at the same time.

Kim Chi has me hooked; I can&#039;t wait to session with her again!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Wow! I just had a body and belly worship session with Kim. She&#039;s sweet, professional, and communicative. She wore the silver micro-bikini that I bought for her, and her thick, tattooed bod looked hot in it. She&#039;s very good with her touch and we pleasured each other sensually. She really enjoys having her deep innie belly button worshipped. She also has a bear hug that can rival that of Zangief from Street Fighter! I had a great time with her, highly recommended!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This review is overdue but I had a fantastic time with Kimchi. She was very easy to contact and in person had so much good energy. We did some boxing and some wrestling. She landed some pretty good hits with boxing. But the wrestling was where she really turned it up! I&#039;m 5&#039;10 210lbs and she wiped the floor with me. I legitimately tried to use my strength but she wouldn&#039;t budge and easily put me in every hold - scissors, armbars, facesits and more. She has so much stamina and a surprising amount of strength for her frame.  You won&#039;t be disappointed at all!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Kimchi was my first ever session, and when I say she put me at ease right away that would be an understatement! She was amazing, gave me everything I was looking for in a session and even chatted with me after! If you get the chance go session with her!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I’ve had many sessions, but never before one where afterwards I was left completely satisfied yet still wanting more. Over the course of our semi-comp wrestling/domination session she scissored, squeezed, smothered, choked and trampled me into oblivion - all while dishing out the most perfectly believable trash talk. Kimchi is tough, gorgeous, great at what she does and…punctual ! Can’t wait to see her again.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This review is long overdue one two words to describe Kim passionate and competitive. I had two amazing sessions with her our first session she wasn’t feeling to good but still brought it our one hour session felt like two hours. Unfortunately we didn’t finish our first session but she definitely made up for it in our second session between her submission holds and her extremely strong legs. I tried to keep up. She is so awesome extremely nice I enjoyed our conversation after our session I felt like I knew her for years. FYI do not let her height full you she is no joke. I definitely will schedule another session with her she is worth it.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I just had an awesome session with the wonderful Kimchi. She is so much fun, with a great sense of humor. She &quot;Showed me the ropes&quot; even to explore the types of session fetishes i might be into. Kimchi is very strong, much stronger than you think and I&#039;m a larger dude. I highly recommend Kimchi. Thanks for an awesome time and cant wait til she&#039;s back in my area!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I just had an amazing session with the wonderful Kimchi. She is so much fun, with a great sense of humor. We laughed and wrestled hard. Kimchi is very strong, good grappling skills and went the whole session with only a few breaks for water. I love the soreness I feel after a session and she gave me plenty of the good soreness. I highly recommend Kimchi. Thanks for an awesome time.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This review is long overdue. I had the priviledge of sessioning with Kim Chi just after she was attending the Exxxotica Expo a few years back. Although petite, every inch of that women is powerful. But nothing was more powerful then her attitude and spirit. I truly enjoyed looking up from the floor as she stood on me in a victory pose.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;em&gt;05/06/2018&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;
I had a session with Kim during a recent visit to Boston, and it was a fantastic time. Do NOT let her size fool you, she is very strong and will put you in your place if you choose to underestimate her. Her scissors are deadly, and her gorgeous eyes and smile will melt your will as she dominates you in a schoolgirl pin. She is cute, sexy and sweet all wrapped in a petite but powerful package. I highly recommend. ]]></description>

I was very lucky to meet with Kim. She has a great personality and is a real beauty. Her pics are nice but they do not give her justice. She is in great shape and she was a lot of fun as we had a semi-competitive session. I will def see this beauty when she comes back to the Big Apple. ]]></description>

5-31-18 I had the pleasure of meeting Kim and she was a pleasant surprise in person. Bubbling personality , full of energy. Our session was fun with a little intensity. She&#039;s not a clock watcher, she&#039;s just energetic and ready to go.go go. I don&#039;t want to leave out that she&#039;s pleasing to the eyes too. I&#039;m looking forward to a rematch with her . Tap you out. Lol. Thanks DB ]]></description>

I was able to meet with Kim and another wrestler and it was an awesome time. Kim was friendly and got me comfortable enough to really explain what type of match I wanted and accommodated. She is full of energy and that competitive personality just makes the session even more enjoyable. Looking forward to our next match! ]]></description>

Had a great time with Kim in San Antonio for a boxing session. She is very energetic and playful. KO body &#038; personality! She is also very easy to talk with and seemed to have as much fun as I did. I definitely recommend her and look forward to seeing her again soon! ]]></description>
