					<description><![CDATA[Hello everyone  !
Big compliments for this great mix session wrestling. Thank you Andrea, coming to Cologne under these difficult circumstances during the 2024 European Championship is worth a lot of respect.
I am thrilled and impressed with Andrea. A real queen in the session scene. Lively, agile with very good technique, experiencing her combat experiences, wow. Great technology, always a smile afterwards. You won&#039;t get bored, time flies too quickly. I love the Italian temperament.
Really great.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I had a double semi-competitive boxing session with Ambra and Andrea where I boxed for 30 minutes with each of them! First, I started with Andrea! This was my second time boxing with her and I can say for a fact that she has become much stronger and more skillful since our last match! Her defense seems pretty much impenetrable and her offense is the real deal! As for the fight goes, we started slowly by trading some punches and I have to say that she can take a punch like a champ! As the fight progressed and we got to know each other better, the fight became more intense and it was obvious the difference in skill, as for each punch I landed I received at least 3 out of nowhere! Andrea is a real slugger, as she prefers to trade punches, and you would be amazed by how strong she hits, as her punches are the real deal and can make you see stars! Also, a piece of advice: Don’t let her corner you as she can easily knock you out if she wants to! As a result, I can say that she completely dominated the fight! After half an hour had passed it was Ambra’s turn! Ambra is very good at evading your attacks but at the same time, she can be deadly, as she prefers close combat and can stun you if you are not careful, as her attacks are very quick and strong, as she also hits hard! All in all, I had a great time with both girls, as apart from great fighters, they are also very nice and funny people who want to make sure that you enjoy yourself and get what you wish for! So to conclude, my session was 11/10 as it exceeded my wildest imagination! I really can’t wait to meet them again! Thanks, Ambra and Andrea for a perfect session!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Today was my first session with Andrea! We agreed to a 1h semi-competitive boxing session and 30 minutes of wrestling! First of all, Andrea is more stunning in person than in her photos! She is a really warm and funny person that will make you feel comfortable from the first minute that you meet her! As for the session goes, we started with boxing! I have to admit that I felt pretty confident before the first round although I had no previous experience! Boy was I wrong! We started slowly by knowing each other and I even managed to catch her 2-3 times with blows to the face, but she didn&#039;t even faze! On the contrary, she came back at me strong and stunned me with her powerful punches! Between the rounds, she was funny and was making sure that I was enjoying the session! As the fight progressed and I started to get tired, it became clear the difference in skill! Andrea could easily knocked me out if she really wanted to but she spared me in the end! This girl not only packs a punch but can take one too and will surprise you with her power and technique! Every boxing fan out there should try her boxing skills and won&#039;t regret it! After boxing, we moved to wrestle! If you find yourself in her headlock is game over! Also, I finally found out what a headscissor is! Again, you will be amazed by Andrea&#039;s strength! If she starts to apply more pressure in her grips it&#039;s a good night! 

All in all, my session today was 10 out of 10! I really can&#039;t wait to meet her again for our rematch! Thanks, Andrea for the best session of my life!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[We all have a bucket list, I’m sure, of the girls we’d like to wrestle. Andrea has been at the top of my wish list for quite some time, and I finally got the opportunity to meet her in London today. 

I asked her for a fantasy session, but you&#039;d never know it was, with my screams probably waking the neighbours (much to her amusement). Her head scissors are deadly. She started off easy on me, but as the session wore on, she began to apply more pressure and totally dominate me, even cheekily ignoring my taps several times, to really play with me. I loved every second of it <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

As Andrea doesn&#039;t travel to London much, I have another session with her tomorrow, then a double (with Ambra) the day after that. Making the most of her time in the UK. My neck is sore, and will be sorer after our third encounter I&#039;m sure, but totally worth the discomfort <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

Andrea is utterly charming and delightful, with beauty and strength in equal measure.

Thank you, Andrea. It was a real pleasure to meet you <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I had my first session with Andrea, when she visited Amsterdam in October 2022. This was also my first session ever. I could not hope for a better experience! She was fantastic in creating a very relaxed atmosphere and in making me comfortable. Communication to book the session was quick, precise and professional. 

As I expected, she was very small but also very strong and flexible. I actually expected to have a good advantage on her, given my almost 20kg difference in bodyweight. Also, I sport at least 5 times a week and I am decently fit. However, my zero experience in wrestling did not help and it didn&#039;t take long for her to throw me down, put me in different holds and make me submit. I was very surprised that such a small girl can put you in so much pain. During the hour she scored 9 points, whiled I scored only 2 points.
I was particularly interested in experiencing bodyscissors and she actually tried multiple times to apply them to me. I could well resist her bodyscissors, however, at the very end of the session she got my back and put me in a very tight one. I could not believe it but finally I had to tap due to her tight bodyscissor. I still cannot believe it!  

During the session we had a small break because, when I grabbed her ankle, I accidentally touched her tattoo which is in removal process (sorry again Andrea!). We had to take a 5/10 min break and this was actually of good help for my cardio! Due to this, she prolonged the session for 5/10 minutes.

I hope she will come back to Amsterdam soon!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have just met Andrea and Ambra in Milan for a boxing session. Well, this is the best session I ever had. Andrea and Ambra are two gorgeous girls, they are very kind but when we started the match, they turn the game into a whole new level....
We started slowly but it became more and more intense. They really put their passion into the session and it was incredible. I receive several punches on the face and be knock-down and put on the ground.

Communication was very clear, they answer fast on emails and we set the session very quickly. They are very kind and you just have to watch IFW videos to see that they have serious skills in wrestling and boxing.

Thanks again girl for this amazing session, I really enjoy it ! Love to see you another time for a revanche.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[A couple of months ago I booked a one hour session with Andrea. She Is a very beautiful,kind and friendly girl. She could appear small and skinny but on the mat she Is impressive. A skilled,fast and agile wrestler with ABS of steel and strong legs. I am a fit guy in a good shape but against her i had no chance. Every attempt to catch her was a failture and her scissors are inescapable the only way to get out was to tap. She Is also &quot;foot fetish friendly&quot; and allowed me to rub and kiss her feet.]]></description>
