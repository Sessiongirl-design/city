					<description><![CDATA[I have never dealt with Jennifer in person, I would love to try her on. She is a true professional and pioneer in session type wrestling. I would love to try her moves and strength on and try to knock me out. Jennifer is not a Princess in my opinion she is a Queen. I love your personality and hopefully if you come up here in Mass. in the future I would love to meet you and take you on. With love]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I’m a producer out of LA and Jennifer Thomas is one of my favorite people ever to work with. Although I didn’t do a session with Jennifer her skill was remarkable and OMG I didn’t know there were so many different ways to wrap your legs around someone!! She goes from transition to transition seamlessly it’s like a never ending combo of scissor holds and variations of them I almost couldn’t keep up and she’s so strong lifting her opponents like toy dolls. Jennifer is seriously the Queen. Also this is not some bias opinion or anything but she is seriously the sweetest person I’ve ever met in this industry she will go out of her way to be helpful and I think once you’ve connected with Jennifer you’ve got a life long bond.. book her and you’ll see.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[One day I hope to meet Jennifer Every chance I get I read Jennifer&#039;s reviews and I wonder if it possible to session with a woman or even meet a woman who all of you claim to be perfect. So many people can&#039;t be wrong so I look forward to the day I meet her just hope I don&#039;t get star struck and just stare into space<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f603.png" alt="😃" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Speaking of which I keep reading of people being KO&#039;ed by her now she really has my attention. If you ever been KO by Jennifer what is that like? Details please share!
Love what you do for the people I believe you do care about each and everyone of us as individuals not a group. Look forward to meeting you one day!. Any trips coming over to NYC?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[CRAZY <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f61c.png" alt="😜" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f602.png" alt="😂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f602.png" alt="😂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> is the only word I can come up with when describing her strength. Had an incredible session with her during her Atlanta visit.  I must admit I took her nice sweet innocent personality for granted after watching her interview. I was clearly wrong <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f602.png" alt="😂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />. I give the whole experience from setting up the session to having the session a 15/10.  
I am looking forward to seeing her again to  session when I travel out to Cali.    Note:  remember to tap on time or you will <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f634.png" alt="😴" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f634.png" alt="😴" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f634.png" alt="😴" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f634.png" alt="😴" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve always thought of Jennifer as one of the most desirable women on the internet, and it was a dream come true to finally meet her in person. Not only is she better looking in person, but she has a fun, warm, and friendly personality. And, with a voice like Calliope, she quickly put my mind at ease even before we started to wrestle. Like a light switch though, she can change into a fiesty and determined  s-tier grappler that will have you on your heels. She was quick to understand all of the nuances I enjoyed in a match. It was rough, sweaty, and very competitive and her trash talking and choice of attire was exceptional. She didn&#039;t hesitate to fight dirty as well which created a very primal atmosphere at times. When I read her profile, I knew she believed she was strong, but a part of me always wondered if our definition of &quot;strong&quot; might differ. It absolutely did not. She can tear your head clean off your shoulders with her headlock if you are too stubborn to tap out. She even muscled me into a few holds I never knew existed.

I truly hope she visits close by again. No one should miss an opportunity to session with the queen. Treat her right and she will make your dreams come true.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Simply the queen of the business! Laid back, down to earth, easy to set up a session with, and can flat out out wrestle anyone who dares take her on. She’s <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f525.png" alt="🔥" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f525.png" alt="🔥" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />as hell on here… n even more beautiful in person and after talking to her. If she’s in your city and you miss Jen, it’s your fault. Jen is a definite MUST SEE!!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Had the pleasure of doing a tickling session with Jennifer this past fall. Jennifer is wonderfully, hysterically ticklish and her reactions when I found a good spot were among the most hysterical (and amusing!) that I&#039;ve ever seen! Jennifer herself was warm, kind, and asked lots of questions throughout to make sure the session was meeting what I hoped to get out of it.

Highly recommended for any session if she&#039;s in your area!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I just had the amazing opportunity to session with the one, the only: Jennifer Thomas!

I was so surprised when the LEGEND and founder of SG, Jennifer Thomas, reached out to ME after seeing my male profile! It was truly an honor to have someone who is so well established in the pro wrestling and session wrestling world reach out to me. I have been a fan of hers since the days of Kickassgirlz/Knockoutgirlz in the late 2000&#039;s-early 2010&#039;s. My brothers, if you love mixed/session wrestling, SIGN UP FOR A MALE PROFILE!!! It is a great way to connect with the girls, provide them with a sense of comfort/safety, and support them. Anyways, onto the session...

We had the unique chance to do our session in an actual wrestling ring! We warmed up by running the ropes together and moved on to my usual session requests: HARD belly punching/kicks/knees/elbows, trampling, foot worship, and belly worship. Jennifer is super strong and gave me an awesome ab workout! We had great conversations during the session too. 

Jennifer is truly passionate about and dedicated to the mixed/session wrestling community. She recently went out of her way to help MMA Aiden and I find a private, safe location for us to have our session. Jennifer goes above and beyond to make sure that the girls and their clients have a safe, fun experience and that their privacy is protected. It was truly an honor to do a session with her, and I look forward to more in the future!

					<description><![CDATA[I have seen Jennifer more times then I even want to try to count.  She was my first session ever in 2019 and I just saw her again this past weekend.  This woman is ageless, she is beyond gorgeous, sweet as can be and as dangerous she as she is beautiful.  I can&#039;t get enough of having her climb all over me (I am a foot taller and 200+lbs heavier then her) and giggle as she puts me seemingly simple holds that I cannot escape from or move in.  Jennifer is the GOAT of the session industry.  If you haven&#039;t seen her, you need to fix that.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Though I have never shot with Jennifer, I must say that she is indeed the pioneer of this business. Jennifer is the founder of Sessiongirls and she is responsible for the prosperity and taking our session community to the next level! Ever since meeting her in LA 3 years ago, I was amazed by her kindness, beauty and professionalism. She truly ages like a fine wine, and sets the standard and example for so many women!  Hopefully one day I get to experience her scissors! I want to say thank you to her for hard work and dedication to all the women and men out there in the session community and changing so many lives for the better!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I had a competitive wrestling session with Jennifer  last night.  I couldn&#039;t believe how strong she was.  She totally dominated me.  She shrugged off my attempts to mount any type of offense.  Her trash talking was awesome.  Her beauty is unmatched.  It was a great session.  One of, if not the best, session I have ever had.  If you get a chance to session with Jennifer,  TAKE IT!!!  You will never forgive yourself if you don&#039;t.  Session with the best...and the. best is Jennifer.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I am a fan and a studio producer. I booked Jennifer for a shoot and admittedly was very nervous to work with a wrestler of her caliber. She was extremely inviting, helpful and humble. Aside from being an amazing performer you can tell she’s a good human being. When going over moves she was very innovative and offered her own twist which made it that much better. It was almost unbelievable seeing the switch from how nice she was to how mean she can get when the lights and camera were on because boy could she flip that switch. Professionalism personified. When she had to play the role of the jobber she could do it seamlessly. But don’t let that fool you because when she was mean she can really dominate. Her movement was powerful and fluid at the same time and her verbal onslaught was equally impressive. Really remarkable to witness her athleticism. Looking forward to working with her down the line. Couldn’t have been happier with the results of the action.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Robin/Fightbabe and Jennifer Thomas review

I was in Los Angeles on business and had always wanted to have a 2 vs 1 role play session against Robin/Fightbabe and Jennifer Thomas.  Fortunately, they were both available on the date I was in town and was able to arrange my “dream session” with the two of them.

As I am “older” and no longer able to do semi competitive sessions anymore, this was more of a fantasy role play session where they were in control the entire time and put me in all different types of submission holds to wear me down and make me submit to them over and over.  At times it was 2 vs 1, and other times they took turns tag teaming to beat me up 1 on 1.    One of the highlights was they had me on my knees and made a sandwich of me with one pressed up behind me and the other pressed up against my front.  The pressure against me from both of them was too much to take – I had never been in a position like that before. 

In the role play scenario, I challenged each of them to try to knock me out with a rear naked choke or leg scissors hold, but not let me know when they were going to apply it.  Jennifer got me first when she was able to get behind me and applied a rear naked choke before I could react and defend myself and I was out in under 5 seconds as last thing I remember I was lightheaded and fell to my left side before going out.   Robin teased me all through the session about knocking me out and waited to the end when I was well worn out and could not defend myself.  She took her sweet old time torturing me with a rear naked choke slowly applying pressure, making the anticipation of going out unbearable.  Not sure how long I was out but when I came too, it felt like I was out for awhile in a deep sleep and had a dream that happened in fast forward that I couldn’t remember what I had dreamt.  It took me awhile to come to and figure out where I was.  When I was fully alert, I had a smiling Robin standing over me enjoying her successful sleeper hold. 

I highly recommend if you can set up a session with one or both of them – DO IT!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I got the chance to feel the power of Jennifer’s legs in Chicago during the scissors circle….and she did not disappoint.  Next up is to have a session with the Queen.  Jennifer is one of the sweetest people that I have ever met…and I am not easily impressed.  She took time out right after the live show to talk to me for a good bit when I know she had other things to do to keep the show moving along.  I appreciated that.  If you ever get the chance to meet or session with Jennifer DO IT!!!  You will love it.]]></description>
