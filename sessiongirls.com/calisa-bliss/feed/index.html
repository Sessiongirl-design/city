					<description><![CDATA[There is so much to say about Calisa! I booked her along with Bella Lux and we made some great content. Calisa communicated her boundaries clearly and had all the outfit selections I requested. She put her stamp on the shoot which enhanced the content ideas I had in my head going into the shoot.

I booked her for the day, and she was efficient moving from scene to scene. Absolutely a joy both in and out of scene, and just owns the scenes she&#039;s in.

Calisa can do it all and was extremely helpful on set. Definitely recommend her for shoots, sessions, customs, and whatever else she does. She is absolutely on my rehire list.]]></description>
