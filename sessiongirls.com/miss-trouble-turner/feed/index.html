					<description><![CDATA[I met Trouble at Fetish Con.  She is wonderful in getting to know her and making friends with.  I was very lucky to have the opportunity to do a four-girl session with her, Constancecakp, Andi Vicious and greasyrose.  She is quite dominant and takes direct action very well.  She is not afraid to perform activities to make men happy like hard spankings.  I really hope to see her at next year’s Fetish Con if not sooner.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I did my first session of 2023 (and in quite a while) with Trouble Turner out of Tulsa, and it was a lot of fun.

She responded to emails very promptly and was very friendly as we set things up, and even moreso in person.

The location had plenty of space, access to water, and bathrooms to change in. She could use a few more mats (she does have some, but we went off them most falls.)

While she only lists fantasy wrestling, she actually likes it if you put up some resistance, and we both won falls during the session. She&#039;s coming from a fitness/yoga background, so she&#039;s in good shape and she&#039;s strong (not to mention flexible, as she mentions above).  I am not in such great shape, so she had me worn out pretty quickly.  

Overall, it was a great session and a great way to start the new year.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I had a session with Miss Trouble a week ago at her studio.  She responded quickly to all emails and was great when we had to work out a last minute time change.  She is new to the scene but was an absolute ball to wrestle.  She is flexible and strong and enjoys the match.  We talked and she made sure the session was just like I wanted it.  I look forward to seeing her in the future.]]></description>

Can&#039;t wait till our next one!]]></description>
