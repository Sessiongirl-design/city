					<description><![CDATA[What can I say about what a treat it was to face off against Emy Black Angel?

We met in a space with plenty of mat room and both had on gi tops.  She was able to me down and make me submit   at will either starting in the standing position or on our knees.  You can tell she is well trained in martial arts by the different take downs and submissions holds she was able to use on me.  I was all sweaty by the end of the session with all the struggling I was doing to defend against her as she was not tired at all at the end of the session.

Definitely one of the most beautiful and smartest session women out there.  I look forward to facing off against her again.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I saw this woman a few years ago maybe 2018-2019 In Long Beach, CA. Easy to contact. She has a very mysterious vibe to her in person because of her Romanian background which I absolutely LOVE! She was very strong. Did many lifts. I was 5’8 220-230 at the time. I would say she was in the 180 pound  range on the thick side which I love. Solid legs and buns!  The most impressive one was probably a shoulder sit.  Not a clockwatcher at all. I know the  last few years she has had health issues and I hope she is doing better.]]></description>
