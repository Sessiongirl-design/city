					<description><![CDATA[I have a bad habit of getting carried away when describing great sessions and great sessionettes so I&#039;ll try (but cant promise) to keep this one brief. From the very first email I sent to the last hug on the way out of the door Luna provided one of the most professional, organized and pleasant experiences I&#039;ve ever had sessioning. 

Luna responded to my initial email promptly and recommended a change in dates to ensure any delays to her travel itinerary didnt impact her session schedule which was the first big green flag! Anyone who&#039;s sessioned with travelers before knows how easy it is for providers to lose track of their schedule and overbook themselves let alone international travelers.

From there it was a very straightforward and quick process of summarizing what I was looking for in a session, costs, deposits etc... 

As far as the session itself Lunas pictures really don&#039;t do her justice, she strikes the perfect balance of firm &#038; muscular while still being soft &#038; feminine. Her muscles arent just for show either Luna really loves to wrestle and she&#039;s very very good at it! Another awesome things about Luna is that she places just as much if not more of an emphasis on hygeine as I do and she looks, feels and smells great at all times! 

Funny enough the only con to our session was that I&#039;m a very big/tall guy and the room was so small that when I laid on the mats diagonally my feet and hands touched the opposite corners of the room. 
We were both dissapointed that the space was too small for us to have a safe semi-comp session but the room size was just an unfortunate coincedence and outside of Luna&#039;s control. 

Instead we just hung out and put each other in holds and chatted about our various session interests. I was impressed by Luna&#039;s excited desire to feel my power. She wasn&#039;t intimidated by my size at all and requested that I put her in several holds and slowly increase the pressure until she needed to tap. She&#039;s a great sport!

While we were getting to know each other Luna also mentioned that she trained boxing in the past as well and I can confirm she has the hardest belly punches I&#039;ve ever felt. Her technique was perfect, the punches were short with no wind up but they were painful enough that the next week I started training my core heavily again at the gym. I kept a poker face while she was punching me but inside I was only 2 punches away from tapping before she got distracted and put me in a different hold. 

That review ended up longer than I wanted but Luna&#039;s a real unicorn in this industry and deserves the praise! She&#039;s got a great personality, is professional and has been sessioning long enough to tailor your experience to whatever kevel of fantasy or competitiveness you desire so you should definitely book her the next time she travels to the states!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My Review of Our 2nd Session this past August. It&#039;s long read! You&#039;ve been warned!

If ever there&#039;s a Mt. Rushmore the Women of Session Wrestling, it&#039;s hard to argue how this mythological gem of a woman doesn&#039;t belong, in my opinion of course. I&#039;m only one mere witness in this young lady&#039;s storied career. She&#039;s been such an anchor for this industry for the last decade plus. Ms. Luna Fighter is known throughout the world over as &quot;The Best!&quot; That is not just me gushing over her even though I would assume all guilt if you charged me with absolutely no shame or guilt. That has just been the reputation she crafted with her art, mastered with her skill, maintained with her business acumen, and been promoted throughout this industry. This is an attempt to give a review of the glorious second encounter of my friend and the women wrestling phenom known as Luna Fighter.

As I stated before, this review will attempt to do our experience justice, but whatever I say will fall short of the magic that was on full display on her part. You don&#039;t like long reads, just skip to the last paragraph... NOW! Alright now that I see that you have the attention span that can endure longer than a TikTok clip it time to give my endorsement (or review... whatever you want to call it). I stated before that this is my second meeting with Luna. She was also my first session and been the catalyst of my addiction... mm-hmmm I mean my hobby of sharing grips with these extraordinary women! They say that &quot;you never forget your first.&quot; That statement couldn&#039;t ring truer with Luna. After our first encounter, I was blessed to be granted permission to check in on her from time to time and to do the same. When it got close for her to arrive for her U.S.A. Tour, she hit me up. I made sure I was properly prepared for her arrival (deposit, balance, outfit, grooming... the whole nine yards). Luna is easily one of the most responsive women I&#039;ve come across here and in this niche period. No disrespect to all you wonderful ladies, I just know that fewer women put in more time in responding to bookings, content, reviews, etc. When we got together for the final confirmation of our date and time to meet, I knew that I had to be ready for fireworks. Truthfully, I have stumbled across the threshold over-preparedness. 

Finally, it was the night of our session. I certainly filled with butterflies in my stomach. I wanted to make the occasion special. However, I made an egregious and inexcusable error that will never be repeated with her or anyone else. I was two hours late for our session. I thought that ANY moment she would cancel on me and just say forget it because she had to travel to NYC the next day. She didn&#039;t. I arrived bearing gifts and profuse apologies. She forgave me and expressed that she was just grateful that I arrived. While I was glad and grateful that she still wanted to connect; I will NEVER make this error again. I can see that she was disappointed. She later told me that &quot;I&#039;m not upset that you we&#039;re late, I disappointed that our time together has to be cut short.&quot; Wow! That&#039;s when I knew that she was a real one! So, you want to know how she whooped my tail after I showed up two hours late. Well, I&#039;ll tell you... Right Now!

There was only going to be a short period for me to warm-up. I had all maybe 4-5 Minutes and I would need all of it! We spoke for a little bit about how my training was going. I shared with her that I did move up a belt since our last session. She congratulated me on my success so far. She razzed me a little when she exclaimed, &quot;Oh so you&#039;re going to make it harder for me huh?&quot; I was like, &#039;oh no... the belt color doesn’t mean much especially when it comes to you!&#039; Of course, without my training I would be absolutely CRUSHED! After sharing a few more pleasantries, we slapped five, bump fist and got right down to business. In our first session there was a brief feeling out period because we were unfamiliar, uninitiated strangers. This time we weren&#039;t. Luna went right on the attack! As I stated earlier, ALL of my training had to be implemented. Luna is known the world over for her Amazonian strength and explosive muscle; what goes understated is her vast knowledge of how to use both of those assets. It&#039;s honest why I admire her so much. She is a true martial arts and wrestling tactician. All those factors also produce a lot of pain! She put me in so many holds that I didn&#039;t think I was going to escape. I had no choice but to revert to a defensive game plan to withstand the onslaught! There were only a couple of times I had the advantage. In one of those times was when I was able to hold a scarf hold and isolated her right arm. I had to apply all the training I knew just to keep her right arm. Once the pressure was too much for her resist, I secured a foot and leg arm entanglement for the first submission. That is an Ashi-Guarami for my Judo folks. In her sportsmanship she gave me props for the execution of the hold. While she was saying &quot;Well Done&quot; I wasn&#039;t fooled for I know that she was preparing herself to tap into her next gear. I didn&#039;t have the room to gloat or talk trash because I knew once we finished our break, I had to be ready. After about another 10 minutes we began round two. I&#039;ll be much more accurate and call this round Luna&#039;s Revenge! LOL! Luna wanted to even the score badly and she was determined to make me submit. I was pressed, tossed, and smashed from every corner of the mat. There was a point that we just ended up in a ball of tangled limbs. A securely and expertly Luna taped the mats there were points that the mat just came apart due to the force of our battle. Finally, she secured a Guillotine choke and was determined that this was it! I thought I had the proper framing to defend the choke under my chin but that didn&#039;t matter. She was in the proper position to use defense against me and clamp her strength. It was decision time now. I was either going to &quot;tap or nap.&quot; I gave her the much-deserved submission by tapping her left arm before collapsing on the mat. Our Warrior Queen raised her arms victorious before joining me on the floor. And there we were sweat-drenched, battle-worn, and in a rumbled heap two bodies in complete satisfaction and wonderment of what had occurred. Either of one of us could go another round. We mutually decided to end our combat in an amicable tie. Fortunately, we had some time left. We were done fighting, so we shared a warm, and intimate embrace complete with some muscle admiration on my end. Wow! 

Here is where I must end this story. The inevitable tragedy of all good things... they come to an end. When our time was up, I couldn&#039;t begin to think of a time I saw so happy being beaten to a pulp! This is the type of satisfaction that this mat warrior provides! This is the trademark of her business and her craft. Leaving you with the desire for more! She is top-notch in every regard in our special niche&#039; culture. While I believe every woman who participates in this field is special. Luna just has a unique dynamite in her fireworks. I&#039;m glad to have an esteemed place in her heart as a client. She&#039;ll always have a special place in my heart as a dynamo and superstar. I hope we continue to share a mutual bond and regard each other as the one of most valuable titles one person can share with another... &quot;Friend.&quot; 

Luna Fighter has and will always have my highest recommendation! I don’t have a score, a bar, a rank for her because she truly beyond any of those mere &quot;standards.&quot; What I have is an experience, an endorsement, and a story. Which is probably consistent across the board for anyone who has met her, wrestled her, and even just shared an ice cream cone with her. She is Extraordinary! Book her for being an extraordinary wrestler. However, respect her time and enjoy your session and you&#039;ll receive the gift of who she truly is... An Extraordinary Person and a Phenomenal Woman! 

So, join me in a figurative toast as I raise my glass to the One and Only Luna Fighter! She may stay on the mat as long as she wants because her Legacy is already established and will remain Forever!]]></description>

Wow!!  I don’t know what to say… thank you for the incredibly kind words.  I never knew how erotic my feet were until now.  You were a real gentleman and it was so great to meet you.

Thank you for the gifts too.  Very unexpected.

					<description><![CDATA[I met Luna while she was staying at Kristie Etzold’s house in Tustin, CA on her recent trip to the U.S. Although I quit having sessions a long time ago, I decided to have a session with this amazing woman. I had so many sessions when I was active and never lost a competitive wrestling match against a woman. Luna is incredibly strong and a skilled grappler, I was totally helpless against her, once she was on top of me, there was no way to get out from under her. She glues her body to yours and makes herself feel like she weighs a ton. I knew she could make me tap any moment if she wanted to but allowed me to struggle beneath her for about 10 minutes before the submission. Well, I am well past my prime and have not been training or working out for a very long time but I have to admit that even at my prime I don’t think I could do much against her. She is a powerhouse, with a great physique and a matching personality! If you are into strong, athletic women and she is visiting your city…do not miss her! She offers many different types of sessions and will customize them to your liking as well.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I had an amazing foot worship session with Luna in Philly. It was by far the best foot session I ever had. She is stunning, perfect body, and has a very friendly personality, she made it very easy to be comfortable opening up to her about my foot fetish. She has some strong beautiful feet. High arches and super soft. The way she smothered me with her perfect feet..the whole experience was unbelievable. Extremely arousing. I didn&#039;t want the session to end. I will definitely be booking another session next time she has another USA tour.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[During Luna’s recent USA tour, I had my first session with her, ever, in Boston. Luna is a session wrestler that I had wanted to meet for quite some time and I’m extremely pleased by my choice. 

I KICKED HER BUTT, not, haha 

Truth is that I couldn’t move her!  

I’m 58, I like to think or consider myself still fairly strong and not ready for diapers, but I seriously couldn’t mount any kind of attack or even get started. It was pretty much all defense for this guy. 

Funny thing is that I actually have some training. I’m a black belt in a martial art discipline. Yes, a bit rusty and I’m also dealing with some health related issues, but I would never take away Luna’s just due! 

We chatted quite a bit. Extremely down to earth, an amazing person and quite accomplished in the martial arts, BJJ herself. So, you’re not going against a slouch. Luna is well skilled and highly trained. 

She knows your limits, knows when to back off, knows when to crank up a little more heat and enjoys her clients and providing a quality experience. 

Treat her with respect and you’ll receive the same in return. 

Physically, BEAUTIFUL, a brick wall of muscle and what I truly call a specimen.  My personal preference, maybe not yours, but Luna works extremely hard at keeping herself in top-notch physical shape. 

She can and will overpower you! 

My experience was fantastic!  I feel like I made a new friend across the pond and look forward to seeing her again. 

I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND LUNA TO ANYONE LOOKING TO SESSION. She will absolutely cator to your ability and needs!

What a beautiful surprise, thank you so much.  I had so much fun in our sessions and it was an absolute pleasure to meet someone as interesting as you.

					<description><![CDATA[I can&#039;t add a lot more to all of those existing reviews about the amazing Luna, but it wouldn&#039;t be fair from my side to leave her without any review after having 2 astonishing sessions with her.
In addition to being an amazing fighter (my belly still wearing beautiful bruises after her amazing powerful punches) she is also an amazing forced  fitness personal trainer. During sessions she pushed me over my limit and forced me to squat, push up and perform crunches till my muscles were completely exhausted. She also ordered to hold her  in wall-sit and during squats and that was incredibly hard and enjoyable in the time. 
As obvious from a pictures Luna has an amazing body, which is incredibly rare, her upper body her biceps, shoulders and back are extremely ripped and big, while her waist is narrow and glutes and legs are very strong and athletic too but very feminine and elegant in the same time. Log story short, she is a diamond.
Out of session she is a great and lovely girl, it was extremely easy and pleasant to set up a session with her and it was a pleasure to have a chat and coffee with her right after session. Definitely I hope to meet her soon when I will come back to London.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Haven&#039;t been able to leave a review for a while so now is the time to cover a session I had with Luna in  March 3 in Tel Aviv.  
I wasn&#039;t quite sure what to expect when I first came in with the custom mat in the apartment room (I had brought a full roll of black tape to make sure the mat could be put together right).  Needless to say, once the grappling started I knew it would be an experience like none other I have ever felt.  Luna can force opponents to turn up their volume to maximum energy, even in what&#039;s in theory supposed to be an enjoyable, semi competitive match and make them feel at ease the whole time.  She&#039;s one of those where you can tell they were born and brought up to be fighters and that combat was a way of life for them.  
Outside of grappling she was highly relatable and led to the session rushing by as I had felt as though I was reconnecting with a friend I hadn&#039;t seen in some time by the session&#039;s end.
The experience is one I will take with me if I live to be 100 and I hope Luna enjoyed it too.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I had my session with Luna in May 23&#039;

I WOULD STRONGLY RECOMMEND LUNA TO EVERYBODY WHO LIKES REAL SESSIONS.

Just keep in mind that there is no fakery and everything is 100% real.
There is no pussy footing but real challenge and legitimate confrontation with Luna.
Luna is legit to say the least.
If you think you are a strong person and can wrestle just wait till you step on the mat with Luna.
You better be ready for it because Luna will give you some reality check very quickly.

I was ready for everything except her unbelievable physical power.
Dig around the internet and you will find how big weights Luna can lift.
Because of her muscles and power I was unable to attack or do anything successfully.
Luna was like a hard rock and effectively untouchable.
I decided to immediately switch my approach to defense.
I tried to defend myself in the best possible way focusing on my guard, framing etc. to keep her at bay. It was kind of working to a certain degree but not really.
Luna was able to break through my defense by using pure muscle power combined with very quick movements. Luna can be very explosive and dynamic. You would not believe how quickly she can move around you. Sometimes it takes a split of a second and she is already on you back...and you know what happens after that - tap or nap.

Despite of being effectively overpowered by Luna, I know I gave her a great deal of resistance. She was breathing  heavily but complementing me each time when I was resisting well. Luna admitted my defense skills and she was very happy to have such intense battle.
I was disappointed with my performance but in Luna&#039;s opinion I was doing fine.

The thing I have found difficult was that with every minute Luna was stronger and her cardio was improving as session was progressing. It is very strange as it should be the other way round.
Towards the end of session Luna turned into unstoppable power and her energy was growing exponentially.
She was moving like a bullet, super fast and super strong.
At the end of the day I really got my ass beaten - hands down!
 
However, it was a lot of fun and laugh with Luna along the way which is very important thing in a session. Luna is very friendly and has warm personality.
Despite of physical power difference between us it was still a perfect session.
It was also safe because Luna was releasing me immediately after I tapped.
I managed to give her a good resistance and I did not give up to Luna without a fight.
It was good to see that Luna genuinely liked it as well.
Would I repeat it again?
Definitely yes!

I hope it will happen.]]></description>

<p>I WOULD STRONGLY RECOMMEND LUNA TO EVERYBODY WHO LIKES REAL SESSIONS.</p>
<p>Just keep in mind that there is no fakery and everything is 100% real.<br />

If you think you are a strong person and can wrestle just wait till you step on the mat with Luna.<br />
You better be ready for it because Luna will give you some reality check very quickly.</p>
<p>I was ready for everything except her unbelievable physical power.<br />
Dig around the internet and you will find how big weights Luna can lift.<br />
Because of her muscles and power I was unable to attack or do anything successfully.<br />
Luna was like a hard rock and effectively untouchable.<br />
