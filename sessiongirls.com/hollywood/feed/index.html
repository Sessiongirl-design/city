					<description><![CDATA[Met with Hollywood for my third Lift and Carry session with her.  She is just amazing. If you are a wine drinker, Hollywood is like a red wine that just gets better with age.  She a member of my Century Club which is no easy task given I&#039;m a little over 200lbs and I out weigh her by 80lbs or more. I must admit, seeing her wrestle in glow when I was younger, I still feel star struck is her presence.  Hollywood calms me down by being really down to earth and doesn&#039;t carry that Star Mentality of I&#039;m better than you like some pro athletes. I find it remarkable how strong this 120lb girl is and I will need to give her a harder challenge next time I see her.  Hope you are up for it, Hollywood.  Thanks for your kindness and thoughtfulness every time you come to NY.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My first ever session was with Hollywood on 6/25. She was traveling to Chicago that day and it was my day off from work. When I booked my session a few weeks prior, I was ready to fight anyone or anything that got in the way. I love how Hollywood always kept me up to date what was going on. On 6/25 it was raining in Chicago early that morning and her flight to Chicago kept getting delayed and my session with her got pushed back a few times. My stress levels were starting to get the best of me and then out of nowhere the song Patience by Guns n Roses came to my mind (without the part where Axl stomps on the phone to pieces at the end of the video) and thankfully being patient worked in my favor and I did not turn into Axl, because my session with Hollywood went as planned and the whole time I had a smile on my face 10 miles wide and whenever I think about my session with Hollywood I automatically smile. Hollywood is beautiful on BOTH the inside and outside. I can write a 5-page paper on how great of a person Hollywood truly is and I hope to have another session with her in the near future.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Just finished my second session with Hollywood. It’s an honor to session with a legend. She loves her work and it shows. We exchanged some holds, practiced others. Had the time of my life, just did not last long enough. To me, she more beautiful now than she did in her earlier years!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It has been a dream of mine for a long time to meet Hollywood when I saw her in GLOW.  I was not sure she would do a lift and carry session with me because I&#039;m a little over 200lbs.  Hollywood excepted my offer saying she&#039;ll do the best she can. Let me tell you, see is still jaw dropping beautiful. Hollywood surprised herself at what she was able to do with me.  She was able to do 170 donkey calf raises with me.  She still has amazing strength in that slender, sexy body of hers.  

Hollywood was very communicative all the way up to our session. No surprises and easy to set up with.  she is very sweet and has a wonderful personality.  I saw her a couple of days ago and I&#039;m still smiling. you know they say never meet your hero&#039;s: This is one heroine that will not disappoint you.  She is truly awesome and can&#039;t wait to see her again now that I&#039;m on her radar of people to see (yeah for me)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I had the pleasure to make my dream come true, by bringing my favorite model to Paris two weeks ago for a private session. I loved this session from the first to the last minute,  Hollywood is such a beautiful woman and has a nice personnality, she’s warmful, welcoming and open-minded. The session was a fantasy jobber session and I loved her way to play the powerless victim, it was really fun !  If you have the chance to live in the USA, do not hesitate and meeting the heroine of Glow !]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I finally had the chance to wrestle Hollywood this past Saturday.  It was well worth the wait.  She was everything you would expect her to be:  pleasant, personable, down to earth and aging like fine wine.  When I met her, she greeted me at the door, she looked even better in person than she does in photographs.  It was a refreshing having an actual wrestling match.  She can still get you in a variety of holds.  She is the first person to ever hit me with a clothesline during a session.  It was a very back and forth match, but it was disheartening to hear her say how much my backbreaker and body scissors felt good for her back.  Neither one of us could coax a submission out of each other.  After our session, we had a chance to talk for a while.  I got the chance to learn a little bit about GLOW, some of her upcoming projects and life.  It was a pleasure to meet and compete with Hollywood.  If you ever get the chance to meet and/or session with Hollywood DO IT!!!  You will not only have a great session, but get to experience one of the nicest and most sincere people in this world.]]></description>
