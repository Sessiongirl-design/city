					<description><![CDATA[These days I had my first session with Emma Switch and what can I tell you. It was fantastic, sometimes painful but we had so much fun.

Emma looks awesome with her muscled and pretty defined body. So it was a must for me to get a session with her as soon as possible. I am glad she joined Germany this June. I wrote her immediately and made the first amazing experience with her. The email conversation was filled with kindness, appreciation and reliability. She even offered me different opportunities when we had some difficulties to find the date and time. All this made me a positive mood for looking forward to her.

When the day came, I was really nervous. Due to the difficulties to find day and time I had to travel a longer journey to her, but I can say it was worth it. From entering the room she showed me her smile and my nervousness was gone. We immediately started with the wrestling without any conversation about the details, which we already did during the email conversation.

Wrestling with Emma is a big challenge. She is quick, extremely skilled and of course amazing strong. I never had a chance. She played with me like a doll and had her fun. I didn’t get even near to a chance maybe give her a little difficulties not to say take her in a hold. She put me in a variety of holds like all kind of scissors, chokes, pins, armbars and leglocks. Very special was her painful wristlock. My only goal after a while could be to withstand as long as possible and to delay the tapping even a little bit. My punishment or should I say my present was that I could kiss and worship her perfect muscles while flexing.

Between the different grapples we had a friendly conversation in the short breaks. We had soon a personal level to tell each other something about oneself.

After two hours grappling and an armwrestling between my energy dropped from one second to the other. Her holds and scissors were mostly extremely hard and sometimes painful. But she took always care of me and was aware that everything is alright.

At the end I was sure that it shouldn’t be the last time we met and gratefully she agreed giving me further sessions and will text me when she is in Germany again.

Emma Switch is highly recommended and you should book her whenever you have the chance to. You won’t regret.

Emma, thank so much for these two amazing hours.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I just joined the site to give a positive review for Emma Switch. I am not a wrestling client, but rather one of her BDSM clients. 

I&#039;ve been seeing Emma for several years, starting the summer of 2017. Since that time, I&#039;ve seen her once or twice a year - first in Romania, then Antwerp, and once in the US. Since she moved to the US, I now look forward to her European tours and just booked another session for June 2024.

I have played with several BDSM professionals over the years, and I can say that Emma is really great and one of the better ones. I have found her to always be honest, fair, on time, easy to communicate with, flexible in planning, and very pleasant to deal with. (If you treat her nicely and politely without wasting her time she is just great to deal with and very professional.)

With me, Emma Switch has been very sweet, considerate, and caring. She does what she promises and plays the game well with passion and energy. She is not a &quot;clock watcher&quot; and takes time to talk with you before and after a session. She is easy going in these moments and makes you quickly feel comfortable. We do a few of the &#039;more extreme&#039; things and she is very good a walking the line between pushing me hard and yet making sure not to injure me in any serious way. She obviously enjoys what she does and likes a partner who wants to play hard and that is perfect for me. Emma is all action and I like that, but she clearly can play soft and go easy when that is what fits her client best. She is good at reading when to pull back and when to push forward to make a dynamic game. 

Before and after the game she is very nice and charming, but if you ask her to play hard - watch out - because she does have an inner sadist who like to play very brutal... but only if you ask for it. (and I LOVE that!) Since she used to run her own studio(s), she has good BDSM skills with a wide range of play ability. NOTE: she does NOT do intimate, don&#039;t try to ask, that is a fast way to get kicked out and rightfully so.

I normally would not say this, but since this is a review, I can confirm that her body is just amazing, perfectly muscled, no fat at all, the perfect example of a &quot;hard body&quot;. If you like that look, she is very sexy. I have seen a lot of her up close and she is all woman in all the right ways. Emma is also very physically strong and has LOTS of stamina due to her great training. If you are into being dominated, her strength and stamina are perfect for taking full control... while most dominas only do this with their eyes and words, Emma can also add on top physically putting you in your place. Her ability to overpower you is great for CNC style games.

I have not wrestled with her, it is not my kink, but she did once put me in a sleeper hold and knocked me out safely. That was something we did &#039;on the side&#039; before a session just because I was curious what it felt like. I must say, her strong jacked arm around my neck while her Belgium accent whispered in my ear was very hot to me. I was totally overpowered and helpless yet could feel her sexy hard body pressing against me. I do sort of get the wrestling thing after that. :-) She used to wear a lot of latex in our play, but more recently I&#039;ve asked her to wear less so that I can just look at her sculpted muscles as we play, she is very willing to find ways to meet your fantasy needs if you just ask nicely.

Emma Switch requests a down payment upfront and that is only fair since she is busy and puts a lot of time into planning every session. She is worth it! I understand that some &#039;bad actors&#039; have purposely put bad reviews and made up stories on various websites trying to tarnish her reputation, but I can say from my experience they can&#039;t be true. That is very sad, because sex workers have it hard enough without having to deal with that ugly stuff. (I refer to BDSM as sex work even though there is no intimate action.) One reason I wrote this is to help counter act those made up reviews with my real life experience. 

I think more people should get to experience a session with a real pro like Emma Switch, I can fully recommend her, she is amazing: professional, sweet, smart, rock solid hard, totally jacked, and oh so strong and sexy.

If you read this Mistress Emma, I am really looking forward to our next session in June! Let&#039;s make it another great one together.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This will be a long read. If you have some else to do scroll away now! I mean it… NOW!! 

Oh… you’re there here so that means you might be serious about your decision. In that case, good! 
Since starting this ride into this session wrestling world I’ve discovered the joy of learning more about myself and enjoying the company of truly extraordinary women. This occasion would prove no different. Well, there was a slight difference. It was the first time I experienced my pre-session nerves pre-booking! Dare I say a tinge of intimidation. LOL! Why did these nerves set in? Because I knew that attempting to be in session with a truly exceptional superstar of our precious niche community! Who other than the Astonishing Emma Switch!! Who is in fact an exception amongst the exceptions, a phenom amongst phenoms! After reading this endorsement… I mean review, I will hope that you agree. So… let’s get to it!

First, the experience was marked by a journey of communication. And it was quite a journey! I complied with her request for a DETAILED Email to request booking. I made sure that my initial/introductory email was as descriptive and specific as possible. I was eager to comply, being that I like to fancy myself as a writer of sorts. Ha! As it would appear, my email met her standards because she emailed me back within 24 Hours! She laid out Everything in her response: her tribute, the possible length of her stay in town, etc. She left no stone unturned! We had to stay in touch with her for a little bit because she was planning her session itinerary. Apparently, another client was attempting to book her contingent on his health. Emma and I stayed in contact throughout the week as she updates live. Emma is a true professional! Emma’s tone in her emails is straightforward and concise exchanges via email. There are fewer things I love more than a straight shooter! We were able to book a date after getting a final update from her potential session. Once Session Day arrived, we started transitioning seamlessly to text messages. Which I’m glad we did because how else was I going to let her know about me getting caught in traffic, showing up 15 minutes late and parking at the wrong hotel as quickly as possible? After getting through the muck and mess that is well… Me, we finally meet in the hotel lobby. 

Upon meeting, her warm hug and composed demeanor provided a surprising contrast to the seemingly reserved persona I initially perceived in the emails and texts. As we engaged in conversation, the ice broke, and a mutual warmth emerged. However, that did not settle my nerves at all. I knew that once we got on the mat, she would unsheathe a killer!

I made a quick change into my rash guard and shorts as she changed into her gear. After a few more pleasant preliminaries, we slap five and bump to begin our match. Our physical encounter commenced with a lightning-fast initiation. She swiftly applied her Guillotine Choke! If I had blinked, I would have undoubtedly tapped out. Her strength was palpable and terrifying! The lightning-fast application of Emma’s Choke demonstrated her strength and prowess, leaving no room for hesitation. Strong and FAST, certainly a deadly combination! I thought I needed to do something to even the odds a little bit. I decided to shift into a little bit of catch wrestling strategy to mitigate her speed. Suddenly we got tangled in a pinning position and my weight “advantage” came into play. The tide shifted unexpectedly amidst our first scramble. She tapped due to a pinched nerve. The unforeseen tap out offered a brief glimpse of vulnerability and added an unexpected twist to the opening engagement. I can tell she was slightly disappointed because she didn’t want to submit to pressure BUT, she would undoubtedly get her retribution!

We took a brief break, and she remembered that I would bring a Gi. She asked if I’ve brought it and I exclaim ‘OF COURSE!’ We took a break to put on Gis. As we transitioned to our Gis a new layer of her prowess was revealed. Our shining star is also a BJJ Purple Belt and Competitor! It was a revelation that added depth to the encounter, setting the stage for the subsequent rounds. By the way, to answer your next question, YES! She has won a great amount of these competitions. The giant lump in my throat has now grown 10 times bigger. The saying goes… “in for a penny, in for a pounding!” Trust me, you’ll understand I meant EXACTLY what I said! Subsequently after a brief conversation, we resumed our match. Emma went right to work using her advanced skills and immense expertise to ultimately spread me like peanut butter on the mat. Her adeptness at securing an Armbar in our second scramble showcased her technical skill and experience. Utilizing advanced mat sense, she strategically gained the upper hand, exploiting advantages as they presented themselves. She was creating opportunities for me to make mistakes and she masterfully capitalized on them. While she may be able to use brute force and speed, she “Switched” (Pun halfway intended, Ha!) to another asset she owns, her Impeccable Intelligence! She once again observed a mistake and capitalized. The final round culminated in a masterful display of technique a slick and tactical wristlock that concluded our third scramble. Wow! What a battle! 

Despite the ultimate outcome, losing the match 2 rounds to 1, a different victory emerged. We shared a final conversation about her life and her times in the session world. Even invited to possibility to film with her down the road! Honestly, I was just honored to be deemed worthy of a conversation with her after she made me a notch on her illustrious belt!  I left with a sense of camaraderie and feeling that I had won over a new friend through our shared experience. Gratitude filled the air as I thanked her, gave her one last hug, and finally departed. Enriched by the encounter both physically and in forging a new connection. This wrestling session was a powerful reminder that the greatest victories often lie outside our comfort zones. It revealed the importance of open communication, the joy of unexpected connections, and the profound impact of shared challenges. As I left the mat, I did so not only with a deeper appreciation of our underground wrestling world but also with a newfound friend and a heart overflowing with gratitude for the journey we had shared. 

While Emma Switch is certainly appropriately named for our dynamo. She has an uncanny ability to switch from being a stone-cold mat Viper to one of the sweetest individuals I know personally! She is a true credit to her native Belgium and honestly one of its best imports! Yes, that includes the waffles. Oh… don’t believe me! Book her! Go ahead! You made it this far into this read you might as well press send on the email you’ve already drafted! My “Highest Recommendation” is honestly redundant at this point. So, I conclude with a toast to truly one of the B.E.S.T. is the business! As we stand in awe of her grace, poise, beauty, muscularity, and professionalism. For Emma Switch peace, safety and blessings on your journey and tours. May our paths cross again and may I be prepared to welcome the honor. Cheers!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello everyone  !
I&#039;m still totally amazed by this incredibly good session with Emma. Big compliment, after a long wait we were able to meet for the first time yesterday. It had been planned for years. It was worth it and how!!! Emma surprised me in everything and positively, so strong, so well trained, technically great, fast and very personable. Despite my size, I didn&#039;t really have a chance against them, which is totally fine. A little whirlwind with power and gigantic muscles. You could experience their great experience directly. I&#039;m definitely thrilled and impressed, great session girl, great fighter or warrior. She knows exactly what she&#039;s doing. As a man, you have to be able to endure a lot. Guaranteed not to be my last session with her. We&#039;ll be happy to come back on our next visit to Europe. We recommend.

					<description><![CDATA[I met Emma on her visit to Louisville this past weekend, and had a blast. She was very easy to deal with, and to chat to. Being much stronger and more skilled than me, she was easily able to destroy me in our wrestling, 

Because  I had told her I had a background in BDSM, she brought out her rope and tied me up, and (we both) had a lot of additional fun with me tied up and helpless.  It was definitely an awesome &quot;hour plus&quot;, and I am definitely hoping to see more of her, even if that means me travelling to Chicago. (Apparently I was the only one in Louisville who took advantage of her visit, so not so much financial incentive for her to return here).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I recently met Emma when she travelled to London. Even though she was having a difficult time with clients  not turning up. Travel being delayed . She was AMAZING.  She had her own mats. She gave me 100%  . Nothing was to much trouble. I got everything I wanted out of the session. I wanted to find out what it would be like to be dominated in wrestling.  She took me apart bit by bit. 
Every time I thought I had her,she just turn the tables and I ended up tapping out.
Her body looks amazing. 
 I left with a big smile on my face. 
A true professional and very skilled at what she does.   
If your lucky enough to meet her then take it you won&#039;t  regret it.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[WOW!!  I have followed Emma and downloaded videos for some time.  She recently traveled to my state and I snagged time with her.  

Mind-blowing.  She is awesome.  HOLEEE DAYUM is she jacked.  That hard body is real and obviously the result of many years of work.  

She is legit on wrestling.  Strong, skilled.  Can lay the hurt on, but I felt in the hands of a pro the whole time.  She knows what she is doing and it reflects obvious martial arts training.  She is devious in delivering the beat down.  This chick is tiny...but so effing strong.  Loved it.  

The European accent is just the best.  (Despite the strong style, she is a fantastic human.  Really enjoyed meeting her and will session again).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is my second session I&#039;ve done with Emma and had another great time doing Jiu-Jitsu, strength test, leg and arm locks, choke holds, and the list goes on! Emma is hard with awesome tone and strong. She&#039;s easygoing and great to talk with. I recommend for anyone to have a session with her and if she&#039;s in your area book her! I have no regrets having session&#039;s with Emma and will book her again whenever we&#039;re in the same area!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Doing a session with Emma is like diving into a treasure pit filled with every grappling delight imaginable - a body toned and built to imprison you, unquestionable Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu that slips and grips you, and a dominant spirit that ultimately owns you.  Her reign of the mat (and you) is only exceeded by her endlessly warm personality, professional booking practices, and excellent hosting space.  On that last point, seriously, the mats she packed and spread out are easily in my top 5 for wide, clean, safe wrestling spaces that a traveling session person offers.  There is no doubt in my mind that with Emma, you are in the best hands...and legs, for days.  Speaking of days, don&#039;t waste any days (or any time at all) waiting to book her.  Emma goes all over the world, and if you and she are on the same spot on the globe, then get on the same spot on her schedule.  You&#039;ll thank the same lucky stars you&#039;ll see when she puts her triangle choke on you, again and again.  And after you tap with total euphoria, just know the only person who could be happier than you, is her.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Had a wonderful session with Emma this evening. She is amazing and her body is solid muscle. We had an easy session of muscle worship and she put me in some holds. She does not disappoint with her physique and she is strong. You can feel her power when she applies her rear naked choke, then she applied a little pressure and you’re out. The best was her triangle choke. She wraps you up and gaze upon her ripped abs. The last thing you see is her smile as you begin to grey out. It was amazing, she was very easy to talk to and very accommodating. Definitely book a session with her.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve seen Emma for a number of years now, and I&#039;ve always had a great time with her. The grappling is always quality--I&#039;m 6&#039;3, 265 pounds and I&#039;ve won two falls from her in four years. She has nearly endless stamina, quickness, strength, evasiveness. In short, she&#039;s the ideal grappling opponent. Add to that her willingness to give a quality SM experience and love of music, and I&#039;m incredibly happy Emma is on the scene. P.S. She never, ever watches the clock!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I am 6’0 195 strong and fit and had a competitive wrestling session against Emma.   Man she has rock hard muscles as the pictures indicate and she is lightning fast.  We wrestled for about a half an hour.   I brought the best I had and man it was quite the battle.   We were both exhausted and soaked in sweat.   I never got her to tap as I’m not super technical but had the upper hand in the match because of my size.  She got me in a few arm bars but i was able to muscle out.    

I probably won the battle as I edged her out because of the size advantage but if i was 160-170, she probably would’ve beaten me.   

Her posing is super sexy.  She seems to like showing off her shredded physique especially her arms and abs!  

Again she has legit wrestling skills and will catch you in her traps.   She is one of the best technical wrestlers out there with an incredible shredded physique!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Two sessions with Emma two great moments!

I recently met Emma S for the second time.  What could I say about her? I love her.  She&#039;s easy to contact and answer fast.  She&#039;s polite and kind, she can be accomodating with hours or with the type of session you would like to have with her.  

I&#039;m not especially muscular, 170 cm for abut 90 kg, sporty guy but not fit anymore.  I have some strength but I&#039;m not into fighting sport or have about no backgrounds in martial arts, I&#039;m just a &quot;usual guy&quot;.  For this session I asked Emma a grappling session with some of feats of strength, armwrestling.

What is surprising with Emma is how such a little woman is strong, she&#039;s shredded, and has a good cardio (she&#039;s about 160 cm and easily 30 to 40 kg less than me). Sh&#039;es fast, and technically good.  For not taping, my only chance against her was to catch her arms with mines and her legs with mines and hoping I could immobilize her.  In any other way, if I failed catching her legs or arms, I had to tap.  Maybe in ten trials, I could let her tap just once.  About armwrestling, I could beat her with my right arm, but she won with her left one. 

About her personnality, I appreciated her because she&#039;s easy to talk with, open minded, and of course very kind.  I recommand anyone to get a try with her, you can&#039;t be disappointed. Thx Emma!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[One of the most caring and heart of gold session ladies out there!

I was able to do a few videos for her and Kandylegs the past few months... in fact I am still recovering from our video shoot this past Thursday!  Do not, I repeat, DO NOT take her lightly at all!  Once the high five starts at the beginning of a competitive match with her, you will find yourself in multiple submission holds because she is just so quick and skilled!  You might think you got her for a few seconds, but before you know it, she&#039;s got you in a RNC, a headscissors, an armbar, an ankle lock, etc.   

If I had to make a comparison, I&#039;d probably compare it to being in the Hart dungeon in its heyday. You&#039;ll get stretched, you&#039;ll be sore, and you won&#039;t forget how amazing the experience was!

On and Off the mat, she&#039;s an awesome person and someone I truly call a great friend and co-worker!  Don&#039;t delay, book her today!!!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I recently had a multi hour session with Emma incorporating lift and carry, posing, arm wrestling, tests of strength and wrestling. I sent a detailed email to introduce myself and listed what I would like to incorporate into the session. I received a prompt response regarding rates and deposit requirements. We came to an agreement and I sent the deposit and received a response from Emma verifying the receipt. When I first met Emma, she was very friendly and welcoming. She is a little shorter than I and about 30 pounds lighter, but she’s all muscle, her photos are dead on accurate. Not a weak body part to be found, but her abs and biceps truly stand out. I was aware of her wrestling skills, jiu jitsu background and endurance, but was completely surprised by her strength. I never dreamed that someone her size could move me around so easily and defeat me in arm wrestling (it was a tough battle). She travels with mats which is a huge bonus for wrestling compared to wrestling on a bed. I have no formal training in wrestling, judo, jiu jitsu, etc., so it really wasn’t a challenge for her to submit me; she even had to remind me that I was supposed to tap. During breaks, we would talk and I found her very personable and intelligent. If Emma is coming to your location or a location near you, contact her about setting up an appointment, you’ll get more than your money’s worth.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Couple years ago, i contacted Emma for my first mixed wrestling match. We had a meeting in a hotel. She was very friendly, because i was a little bit nervous. We talked for a while, and then we get started. Emma is small, but very strong and muscular  And has a good background off Ju-jutsi. She threw me around the hole room. I try to fight back, but i had no chance at all. In a second she has you in a very power scissorhold, or her big biceps to choke you out. She has a lot of experience, and knows what the custumor wants. She even did me tied op during the match. I was very exiteted. I can recommend anybody to do a session with her. She is one of the great legends in the buissnuis. I very looking out to do soon another session with her!!! And boys..  She is small... But her thighs squeeze you like hell!!!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I shot a few scenes with Emma and grappled with her. She is a skilled grappler and strong for her size. She has an amazing physique very shredded. Emma is very friendly, I had a nice time talking to her. During the scene Emma was very dominant she can be brutal but respected my limits. I highly recommend her, you won&#039;t see many women with such muscle definition and grappling skill.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;span&gt;Since first time seeing Emma Switch&#039;s rock hard body, I became intrigued with finding out what she could do on the mat. When her tour brought her to my town, I jumped at the chance to meet her. Scheduling was simple and straight forward. A deposit was required, based on reviews and how long she has been doing sessions, I knew I could trust Emma with my money. When I had something come up the day before our session, Emma was able to accommodate my request to change our time. &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;As for the session itself, Emma was as muscular and ripped as she appears in her profile pictures. The session was suppose to be semi-competitive, however Emma being so quick, skilled, competitive, confident, strong and with such great conditioning that I wasn’t much competition for her. So she made me tap with arm bars, chokes and any other hold she felt like using. As the session went on Emma, adjusted the intensity to try and keep it from becoming to one-sided while maintaining her dominance. When the session was over we talked for awhile and I found her to be personable, interesting and charming. If anyone is looking to session with a little powerhouse who enjoys being on the mat I highly recommend Emma.&lt;/span&gt;]]></description>
