Had a great session with Safa, she is a very beautiful girl, with a nice body too. She was very nice and personable, and very accomodating in booking a late session time for me. I&#039;m a fit/big guy who works out everyday, but she had no problem making me tapout a few times. Her scissors and triangle holds were great and had me seeing black dots a few times! Plus she crushed me pretty good towards the end, with a bodyscissors that had my ribs really sore the next day. The session went over an hour, but she didn&#039;t seem to mind at all even though it was getting late. She is open and extremely nice and friendly in conversation and was a lot of fun to spend time with. All around great girl! ]]></description>

I had my first session ever with Safa. We started off with some one-sided boxing and she packs a punch- she hits harder than some men. She enjoyed every punch, had me seeing stars after one round, and knocked me on my ass in less than 10 minutes. After that she showed me her scissors and almost snapped my neck off- with her iron strong legs. We ended the session with some facesitting and smothering. I had a great time and would recommend Safa to any first-timers. Also, she looks even better in person than she does in her pics! ]]></description>

I had my first ever session with Safa yesterday, and she blew me away. She&#039;s fiesty, fun, game for basically any (athletic) activity, beautiful, sweet and professional. I&#039;ve written a more detailed review of her here:

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;em&gt;04/12/2013&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;
I just had my first session with Safa Warda. I had asked for a playful, semi-competitive match with no purposefully painful actions on either of our parts. I am not an experienced wrestler and do not have any martial arts training. I’m 5’ 10 and 185 lbs. 
Safa made me feel very comfortable right away. She’s super easy to talk to and very open. She wore a little black bikini and looked gorgeous in it. She had arranged the room so there was plenty of room for wrestling without having to worry about banging into furniture or walls. 
As far as the wrestling goes, Safa is very strong and very fast. She got me in holds very quickly which I couldn’t escape from. After she realized she was dominating me so easily, she started to let me get her in a hold first and then she would wrestle out of my control. I think I only was able to really control her one or two times, and even then not to where she had to submit. Regardless, I loved grappling with her and we both had worked up quite a sweat which she didn’t mind at all. 
After our one hour session was over, she spent about a half hour just talking with me about her experiences which was really a nice bonus. She did not take any phone calls and devoted all her attention to me. I will definitely session with Safa again. ]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;em&gt;04/15/2013&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;
this was my first 2 hour semi-competitive/foot worship session with safa and all I can say is wow! the best session wrestler so far. for someone as small as she is, please don&#039;t underestimate her. she is very skilled and can take probably most guys down. I don&#039;t have any training in mma or any other kind of fighting experience so she knew to wrestle at my level which she still is overpowering. 
her legs are devastating. your not getting out of a scissors hold. anywhere I tried to get her, she countered with a choke, scissors, grapevine, or some other submission move. she even let me put her in a submission move, but I was unsuccessful as she got out of it and submitted me. she even submitted me with her feet which I don&#039;t even know how she did 
as far as personality, shes freaking awesome. shes high spirited and just a cool person to be around. she understood my demands for a session and didn&#039;t disappoint. when we took breaks, she was easy to talk to. 
as far as foot worshipping, her feet are beautiful. sucking on her toes is a freaking experience. I was in a trance when she had them on my face. 
overall, just freaking awesome experience and I highly recommend doing a session with her. she enjoyed every bit of it which made the experience even more better. I will love to wrestle her again soon ]]></description>

If you do a competitive session with Safa, BE READY TO TAP! She is very quick and will submit you with her arms and legs. I tapped 11 times often to holds that were locked on before I knew they were coming. 
Safa is extremely high energy and she provides a great session! She is perfect at adjusting to your level as well. Don&#039;t hesitate to meet her. You WON&#039;T be disappointed. ]]></description>

Safa was my first session girl that I have been with, and let tell you she is AWESOME!!!!!! :woohoo: She was very easy to talk to and was very friendly. We did a boxing session and she was everything that I had thought it would be. She also asked if I wanted to do a beat down RAW for her website and I said sure. I will only say guys, if you THINK that you can handle 10 minutes with her, think again! She can HIT HARD! I am still feeling the effects of her punches. She will be someone who I will session with again and maybe wrestle with her. ]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;em&gt;01/14/2014&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;
I just finished a session with Safa and I don&#039;t even know where to start. Not only was the wrestling amazing, but so was Safa. She was one of the nicest, most genuine people I&#039;ve met in the industry and truly has a passion for what she does. Her energy level never lets up and she&#039;s the perfect contradictory combination of sweet, sexy, friendly, badass, aggressive, and dominant. 
I had initially requested that our match be a fantasy wrestling match, with &quot;a bit of a semi-competitive&quot; edge. This quickly turned into mostly a semi-comp match, because Safa definitely knows how to step it up a level and has so much fun doing it. She dominated the match with a variety of techniques including (but not limited to) scissors, headlocks, arm bars, facesitting/smothering, grapevines, some foot worship and more. She &quot;let&quot; me get the upper hand a couple of times, but based on her adorably evil laugh, I knew it wasn&#039;t going to last long, since she was simply toying with me. 
I&#039;m a 260 pound guy and I consider myself to be fairly strong. Safa made me feel otherwise! Once she locked down each hold, I fought as hard as I could, but always ended up tapping - and even after I tapped, sometimes she wouldn&#039;t let up until I tapped 3 or 4 times. 
I can&#039;t say enough good things about Safa. Not only is she a great person, a skilled wrestler, and a blast to be around, but she&#039;s also definitely not a clock watcher. The only reason our session ended on time was because I realized my cab was about to arrive - she was ready to go back at it! She was welcoming, accommodating, easy to communicate with, and I can&#039;t wait for my next opportunity to session with her again. Safa is the real deal - so if you&#039;re reading this and you&#039;re on the fence - get off your ass and book a session with her because you won&#039;t regret it! ]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;em&gt;02/11/2014&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;
My session with Safa can only be described as magical, mystical, marvelous and exhilarating. It started semi-competitve. She has this uncanny ability to not only listen to what my interests are (scissors, chokes, submissions, being controlled by her even though I&#039;m trying not to resist. It&#039;s as if she has a unique skill - reading my soul - observing all the nuances of my body to push me farther than anyone ever has. I found that the more she pushed me the more I pushed back and realized that as the session got more competitive that I really didn&#039;t stand a chance. She is extremely fast - but never flails around, every move is deliberate. Her scissors are amazing (I tapped so many times - to all kinds), and her chokes seem countless and insanely effective - but it&#039;s her overall attitude that makes the session both fun and intense all at the same time. If you have the opportunity - you have GOT to session with her. ]]></description>

She is extremely fast &#8211; but never flails around, every move is deliberate. Her scissors are amazing (I tapped so many times &#8211; to all kinds), and her chokes seem countless and insanely effective &#8211; but it&#8217;s her overall attitude that makes the session both fun and intense all at the same time. If you have the opportunity &#8211; you have GOT to session with her. </p>

My session with Safa was awesome. She really surprised me with how fast, flexible, and STRONG she was. Mostly I was impressed with her tenacity and energy throughout as well as her technical ability to wrestle. I searched session girls looking for a truly competitive match and boy did I get one. At first glance I didn&#039;t think our session would be that competitive seeing as I&#039;m 21, tall, 195 pounds, and can dunk a basketball but I thought she was very attractive so I booked a session anyways. I was pleasantly surprised that 20 seconds into the match I found myself forced on my back being pinned/smothered unable to get free despite my almost 80 pound weight advantage. From there it was on and we had an intense session that went back and forth. It ended up being the SUPER competitive session I was looking for and I had a lot of fun. The best cardio workout I&#039;ve had in weeks. Safa was really cool and made me feel comfortable during the session with her playful trash talk. She even helped me improve my scissor technique... for the rematch I&#039;m sure. I will definitely session with her again and I suggest you do the same if you want to session with a sexy woman who loves competition and can legitimately make you squeal in all of the best ways. ]]></description>

She is immense - beautiful, sexy and feminine but also very skilled and more importantly, she can be cruel if you ask - she gets the job done so be very careful what you wish for. Armbars, triangles, RNCs, she has the lot and will also be very happy to kick the crap out of you with her lovely long legs. She has an excellent space and is fun to hang out with - can&#039;t recommend enough! ]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;em&gt;10/29/2016&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;
I had the great pleasure of meeting Safa for a session while she traveled through New England. This was my first session ever and didn&#039;t quite know what to expect. She can be a little short in text/emails but don&#039;t take it personally. It&#039;s just how some people communicate. She ran behind coming out of New York so we got started a little later than anticipated (We got hit with surprisingly unseasonable weather for this time of year so accidents were plentiful all over I-95.) 
She was very personable and friendly. We chatted for a bit first while stretching and suiting up, breaking the ice and getting to know each other. We then agreed to just kind of step into it and see where it goes. We started off striking. For someone who professes to only have done a few months of kickboxing she was quite technical and nimble. We had a decent back and forth and ended up putting each other against the wall a few times. 
We then transitioned to MMA after discussing different take downs and techniques. We rolled for some time and she was VERY skilled. Giving me advice and guiding some of my moves while we rolled to help maximize what I was going for, also giving me a few tips to slip out of what she was doing to me. We had quite a few laughs and were very complimentary of each others skill. The final &quot;bout&quot; of the session was considerably more serious and she took me to task with a series of submission holds strung together, tapping me out repeatedly. I managed to get the upper-hand a couple of times but she bounced right back. 
We actually went for an extra forty minutes as we were having so much fun (No extra fee). I helped her clean up the space and we chatted and laughed for at least another 30-40 minutes. The entire session was a real pleasure. I had her undivided attention and really felt not only well complimented but appreciated as a customer. ]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;em&gt;03/08/2017&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;
I have had the pleasure of hosting Safa in Australia for the last 2 weeks. A nicer, more genuine, vibrant and hard working woman you will not meet anywhere in the world. The filming we have done in Australia has created some of the best footage I have ever seen. Safa has a wicked creative imagination and is amazing at improvisation. Although Safa is quite petite she is amazingly strong and fast and will mix it with the very best easily. I would highly recommend Safa as both an outstanding athlete and excellent attitude correction therapist. ]]></description>

&lt;span&gt;11/08/2018 &lt;/span&gt;
I recently met Safa as she made her way thru Boston ,,it was the first time I have ever booked with her , it was simple thru email and I’m going to for warn all that she doesn’t say a lot thru email but when you meet her she has great communication and a great personality and makes sure your session is tailored to what you want and can adjust her levels of skill for you. She is very friendly and beautiful in person with a killer body. I booked a semi comp wrestling session and spent most of my time on my back as she laughed it up while I was wrapped up quite often tapping out. I have wrestled a lot of girls this year and I’d say Safa is in the class of what I would say the Elite on this session girls website or any other website. This girl can wrestle and wrestle hard and makes it so much fun as she beats you on the mat. Her scissors and chokes are some of the strongest I’ve been around and she was no where near full throttle with me. All I will say is any trips she makes back to Boston I’ll be on the roster. If you haven’t met this girl you HAVE to check her out if she’s coming to your city trust me she’s worth it !!! 
Thanks Safa !!!! ]]></description>

I just had a session with Safa in her new studio and she is exceptionally well versed on the mat! I was surprised at the combination of competitiveness and sensuality she brought to the session making it a very enjoyable experience. We both agreed to wear wrestling singlets for our match and by having her own 10x10 mat it made it feel like a real competition. We both tapped each other out several times throughout the time we grappled but she always made sure I was comfortable throughout the session. I highly recommend booking her as she will exceed your expectations! ]]></description>

Had a session with Safa Yesterday which i consider 1 of my best ever, and I&#039;ve had a lot of great ones. She&#039;s very personable and bubbly, great energy, easy to talk to, funny as hell and not a clock-watcher and very skilled. I can see why she is so popular. If you get a chance and she&#039;s in a city near you...don&#039;t hesitate...she&#039;s worth every penny. She responds fast to emails and is very reasonable. Will definitely be working with here again sometime soon. She&#039;s as awesome as awesome gets!!! ]]></description>

Safa is the absolute best of all the women I hired in the past for sessions with my gf. She is professional, she is for real, no fakes no acting and listened carefully to what I meant by domination wrestling and delivered beyond any expectation. If you are in town and looking to have a real pro fulfilling whatever your fantasy is, she will make it become reality. 
THANK YOU SAFA ]]></description>

Safa est une élégante et mince jeune femme mais elle se transforme en furie quand elle se jette sur vous. Elle est très rapide, maitrise parfaitement toutes les prises du jjb qu&#039;elle exécute avec une force incroyable. Headlock, scissors, arm bar, étranglement n&#039;ont pas de secret pour elle.Et si on lui demande quelques rounds de boxe, les coups pleuvent à la face et au corps. Elle frappe avec ses poings, ses jambes (elle a un super high kick) et ses genoux. C&#039;est une super combattante, toujours souriante avec qui ceux qui aiment boxe et lutte compétitive passeront de formidables moments. On est complètement épuisé après une heure de session, mais on n&#039;a qu&#039;une idée: revenir le lendemain. ]]></description>
