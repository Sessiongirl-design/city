					<description><![CDATA[I’ve had my eye on Sinthia for a long time.  Finally, the chance came to schedule a session with her and I am so glad I did.  What a blissful experience!  Previous reviewers have noted how she has put them at ease so quickly and that is definitely true – she greeted me with a warm hug as if we were old friends.  She is also every bit as beautiful in person as she is in her photos – I would even say more so.  In terms of personality, I cannot imagine anyone not enjoying her company in any situation – she is that much of a pleasure to be with.

I requested a semi-competitive wrestling session, even though I knew she would handle me easily.  I told her that and said that one thing I wanted was to test myself for how much pain I could tolerate.  She used multiple holds on me, most involving her lethal legs, although her repertoire is quite varied.  She was also open to my suggestions and she adapted easily to those.  I always stubbornly held out as long as I could without tapping but she never made it easy – no complaints, that was exactly what I wanted.  One of her previous reviewers noted that she loves to punch and while I did not want to be hit in the belly, I told her my arms, legs and buttocks were all fair game.  She took full advantage and her punches definitely hurt.  I could still feel the effects two days later.  But although she can certainly inflict pain, she is skilled enough to avoid causing serious injury.  I was never afraid of that at all.  She complimented me on how much I was able to endure, which I very much appreciated.

I highly recommend Sinthia for any type of session she offers.  I, for one, am already looking forward to another one!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Just finished my first session ever. I was nervous going into it, but immediately relaxed once I met Sinthia. From start to finish I was relaxed and just enjoyed the session. I was greeted with a warm smile, and we started discussing what I was looking for. As it was my first time, we took things slow, and it was incredible. Her legs are not only great to look at but so strong. My neck was so sore the next day! So happy Sinthia Bee gave me my first headscissor and session experience. Could not recommend her more! Thank you again for the great session and I hope we can meet again!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I was very excited to find out someone relatively local in my area was offering session wrestling.  Scheduling and communication was super easy and the meeting was a lot of fun.  We did some light-competitive wrestling for more than the schedule hour, and I had a lot of fun.  She is very strong for her size and, also very importantly, very adept at making you feel at ease. Highly recommend.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I had an amazing experience with Sinthia Bee! The scheduling, coordination, communication, and the wrestling session - all top-notch. There is a reason why she has outstanding reviews. She is gorgeous. She resembles Miley Cyrus but much prettier. The session itself exceeded my expectations. Sinthia is a dominate and fun person who likes to know about your desire &#038; kink and role play to your liking. I have been sessioning since 2007 and this was my first session with Sinthia. I am confident &#038; hopeful to have many more sessions with her. I highly recommend Sinthia to anyone looking for a quality experience in a session.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I had an amazing session with Sinthia today! She&#039;s a total sweetheart and super chill. We started off with a nice sensual wrestling session which is right up my alley since I&#039;ve never been a fan of comp-style wrestling. She&#039;s strong when it counts though! Overall amazing time and I can&#039;t wait to book again. Setting up was also quick and easy which is always a plus. Don&#039;t miss out on her!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[An amazing and beautiful woman!  She was nice enough to session with me on a return trip from Boston.  My first time sessioning with her. She was open, down to earth, and enjoyed exploring my interests and desires to the fullest! I felt like I was in another realm almost the entire 3 hours!  My only regret was not having more time!  She looks awesome in her high cut one piece and she&#039;s worth every dollar and minute you have!  We did some grappling, sensory play, and bondage.  She was respectful and nice enough to let me have breaks - even though she didn&#039;t need them as much as I did!  I hope to session with her again!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Just gonna directly copy-paste in the message I sent Sinthia a little while after our session this evening: 

demolished in an hour. Like - I cannot overstate how mindblowing that was. No one&#039;s ever left me that utterly addled, unable to move, completely collapsed, with breath-play alone. That was *remarkable*

Also it&#039;s insanely impressive the way you held me in that twilight zone like on the edge of unconscious for extended stretches of time. Like I have never spent that much time just on the very edge of passed out. And that’s like my FAVORITE. It feels so utterly powerless and I’m panicked but helpless and it’s SO HOT. When I actually pass all the way out of course I can’t FEEL being unconscious, so what I enjoy is the wave of powerlessness that washes over me as I come to (in addition to the sensation of fading out, when it happens slow enough that I even feel it) - holding me in that twilight on the edge of consciousness just left me STUCK in that space of completely inundating weakness. Your intuitive ability to hold me in that space was out of this world. And I love how I just like … slipped in and out of consciousness a couple times as I lingered there. And I love how you just kept forcing me to tap again and again and again and again. You’re so powerful and then also so incredibly mindful and aware of how I’m responding and the way you connect with your own body and with mine is really just … impressive. You’re uniquely gifted, in addition to being remarkably strong (and absolutely stunning <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f60d.png" alt="😍" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f60d.png" alt="😍" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[There is a reason Sinthia has so many positive reviews; she is very good and what she does.  She is quick to respond to emails and reads them carefully so there is no misunderstandings during the session and makes sure we are on the same page before the session starts. We did a sensual oil wrestling session and she was fantastic throughout the session.  She took a real interest during the session and made sure i was enjoying myself as well, ahh yes!! She&#039;s great at communicating during the session and put me at complete ease.  If you&#039;re looking for a fun sensual session, with a pretty woman, who is incredibly friendly - i cant recommend Sinthia enough and i look forward to seeing her again..]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Had the pleasure of meeting up with Sinthia again for an amazing boxing match mixed in with some head scissors (which she introduced me to)! Sinthia is very quick in her replies and very easy to talk to! 

She started off with some light boxing and then went harder as the session went on, she can pack punch! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f633.png" alt="😳" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> In between rounds she would put me in head scissors until I was close to passing out (which I asked for)! She is amazing to session with, highly recommended!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello people.  This is a long overdue review of Sinthia.  I was very fortunate to have met Sinthia on 2 occasions. The thing I always admired about her is that she is so natural.  No outrageous muscles.  She also has a wonderful personality.  We talked about life and we talked about the 90&#039;s which we all miss so dearly.  I am looking forward to meeting with her again.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Had an amazing session with Sithia yesterday! She was easy to get ahold of and easy to communicate with! Very down to earth and listened to detail!  We agreed to do rounds of boxing! She did not disappoint! She looked amazing, but don’t let that fool you, she can punch! The longer the session went on the more powerful her punches got! She got a few lucky punches in! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f601.png" alt="😁" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Can’t wait to see her again! 10/10 definitely recommend!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[What a fun time!  Met up with Sinthia today for a 90-minute ballbusting roleplay session.  Excellent email communication leading up to the meet.  Sinthia brought all the outfits we discussed and nailed the roles.  Of the 7 sessions I have had in the 7 months, Sinthia is definitely the most sensual, with her sly little smile, cute trash talk, nice body, and sexy personality.  Not to mention VERY accurate kicks (ouchies).  I recommend and would repeat.   Thanks Sinthia!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[All the positive reviews you&#039;ve read about Sinthia Bee are true! I recently had a fantasy wrestling / belly punching session with Sinthia and it exceeded every expectation I had. From the very start, Sinthia was prompt with all email correspondence, making scheduling everything a breeze. Although I was nervous meeting her for the first time, her warm personality and kind energy put me at ease. She made sure to establish what my limits were and asked clarifying questions on the kind of session I envisioned.

I could tell right away how strong and fit Sinthia was. Every hold she put me in was amazing, and I knew she could really turn up the pressure if she wanted to ;) I found myself at times simply staring at her amazing, beautiful body as she had me trapped or pinned down. Believe me, the pictures she&#039;s posted do NOT do her beauty justice.

Since our session, I have not been able to stop thinking about the amazing time I had with Sinthia. I only hope she had a fraction of the enjoyment from our session as I did! If you only session with one girl, make it SINTHIA BEE!]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>All the positive reviews you&#8217;ve read about Sinthia Bee are true! I recently had a fantasy wrestling / belly punching session with Sinthia and it exceeded every expectation I had. From the very start, Sinthia was prompt with all email correspondence, making scheduling everything a breeze. Although I was nervous meeting her for the first time, her warm personality and kind energy put me at ease. She made sure to establish what my limits were and asked clarifying questions on the kind of session I envisioned.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[It was a long time coming, but i was finally able to meet Sinthia for a 2 hour fantasy wrestling session and all i can say is wow did she deliver. Right from the start, she was quick to communicate and detailed in every part of the set up process. From that alone i already knew the session would go way beyond my expectations. She greeted me at the door looking absolutely stunning. We spent a few minutes chatting and getting to know each other before the session started, which eased the nerves of meeting someone for the first time. Once we got started, it just kept getting better and better. Her smack talk was great, her holds were better. Her favorite, which then became my favorite, was her reverse head scissor. Her legs are strong and she’s great at making you feel comfortable throughout the entire match. I very highly recommend booking her and can all but guarantee you’ll enjoy your time as much as i did. I’m already looking forward to the next time we will meet. All around 10/10]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Well, here we go with another review. It&#039;s a long one. This is your final and only warning. 

I have been fortunate to have been able to participate in this small niche community and have had the honor to be graced with the presence of some truly phenomenal women. These ladies have allowed me to participate in several sessions and have given me some of the best times of my life in recent years. What I love about each and every session is that every woman has expressed themselves to me as honestly as possible. That to me is the true thrill, for me to open the floor for them to display their true physical expression of their art. This time was no different. Sinthia Bee is an artist in the truest form of the word. She allowed me to participate in her latest masterpiece! However, this work of art almost didn&#039;t come into fruition. I&#039;ll explain further...now. 

First of all, there&#039;s a common return with other reviews. The comment was Ms. Bee being a consummate professional. I will go ahead and make it an unanimous declaration. I can give plenty of examples prior to our meeting. Booking with her was incredibly quick, simple and direct. What probably made booking quicker is how I elaborated on my initial email. She was incredibly quick to respond. We booking within an hour. She then kept up with me through out the week. Then finally she let me know that there were some last second bumps in the road that may interrupt our scheduled session. She offer to make it right if I choose to cancel. I chose not to cancel. This was clearly the right decision. I thank her so much for her consistency in communication and transparency. This is her mark as an astute businesswoman and entrepreneur. 

We were now able to meet. I was greeted with a very warm hug and a thank you for still wanting to meet. She has shown me that she was every bit a woman of her word. The least I can do is be a man of my word. We were able to share some conversation before starting our time. Her intellect is out of this world. Not to mention were both incredibly awkward which was right at my speed. We were able to connect and become fast friends! She did inform me that she had to make a drive back home and squeezed my session in. I was grateful that she decided to make the time. After we share a couple of more pleasantries we started our match. 

I will lay this out flat, it wasn&#039;t clear if Sinitha Bee consistently works out, and she doesn&#039;t have a bodybuilders&#039; build. This woman is one of strongest women I&#039;ve come in contact with her frame. Using her experience and overall guile she is definitely able to pin any 200+ pound down. She also had some great awareness and natural combat sense which enhanced her combat ability. As someone who has close to a decade of grappling and Martial Arts experience, Sinithia having no formal training gave me a run for my money! I wasn&#039;t surprised that she would give me a great challenge. However, that didn&#039;t dampen my joy and excitement when we got to the grips of our time. Put it plainly, she a helluva wrestler. Truthfully, that wasn&#039;t the highlight of our time. 

Before our meeting, I envisioned how everything would transpire. We wrestle maybe I win, maybe I lose, maybe I absolutely dominated and so on. Ms. Sinithia Bee being the gracious host of our session in her great wisdom decided to tap into a more mutually cooperative occasion. During the course of our match both of our bodies intersected into a stalemate. It was then that we both decided to enter into a little more intimate flow. As stating before, she has an incredible frame. She also happens to have very features; incredibly easy on the eyes (of course you already know this fact). Without going into unnecessary detail, I&#039;ll just simply say that we enjoyed each other&#039;s company. We ended our match in a very amicable tie. We then share some last moment of bubbly quirkiness and laughter before I had to leave. It was remarkable how she flipped the switch to enhance our experience. That is what she brought to the table adaptability and spontaneity. She made our session one of a kind! 

So do I recommend this session extraordinaire, artist, DJ, accomplish pianist, and overall phenom of a woman for your next session. Empathically YES! In addition to my highest recommendation I offer this friendly caveat. It&#039;s quite acceptable to come in with a &quot;gameplan&quot; or &quot;session script&quot; so to speak. I will say with Queen Sinithia Bee; be prepared to throw those &quot;plans&quot; out the window. That is if you want the most of your time (ijs). Every session I had so far have been nothing short of magnificent. The magnificence of this session was rooted in the uniqueness of the host and the settings she hosted that allowed our imagination take the wheel. I didn&#039;t get the type of session I thought I wanted. She gave me something MUCH greater. While I was going through the toughest time of my life; she took her time and curated an experience I needed. I will remain forever grateful to her. I hope to meet her again soon and tell her in person. Thank you so much Sinithia Bee. Peace and Blessings Everybody. Panther out!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Just had a smothering/scissoring session with Sinthia, and she was way above expectations. In between holds, I actually said, “Christ, you’re good.”

Her vicious scissors rendered me helpless, and she rolled around, taking me body with her whichever way she went. It felt like she was squeezing with the goal to pop my head like a watermelon, but when I got a glimpse, she was casually smiling. It was totally effortless to her! I shudder thinking of how much pain she could have actually put me in.

Then, came her facesits. Delicate enough that you can feel every motion she makes, and strong enough that you are not escaping or breathing unless she allows it. 10/10 would be a seat again.

She also communicated extremely well and was totally professional. You will have no complaints if you book her!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Yesterday, I had my first session with Miss Sinthia in NJ.  I just moved to the area recently and have been looking for local providers.  Her glowing reviews got me interested, and I must say now after having done it that everything you read about Sinthia is 100% on the mark!  She is amazing - extremely easy to communicate with and very kind, with a real desire to make her clients happy!  I asked for a facesitting/smothering session with extreme breathplay, and boy did she push me to my limit!  Sometimes its tough to find providers who feel comfortable really pushing you past your limit, but she sat on me with no mercy, and I was screaming the whole time under her haha!  It was a blast, and we both had a good laugh about it after.  Don&#039;t hesitate to book a session with Miss Sinthia - she&#039;s top-tier professional and you will be happy you did.]]></description>
