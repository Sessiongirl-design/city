					<description><![CDATA[Finally, I had the pleasure of meeting Dez on the NY stop of her farewell tour. Despite recency bias, the best pro-style session I&#039;ve ever had, I went in expecting it to be with Dez&#039; pro wrestling experience. It&#039;s crazy to think that it almost was ruined a day before the session due to the &quot;hotel.&quot;

Upon looking up the directions to the &quot;hotel,&quot; I stumbled upon the reviews and they were dreadful. The complaints (from many sites) ranged from cockroaches/bedbugs to bold in the bathroom and pictures were provided. I immediately informed Dez of this legitimate concern. We both agreed the place was a motel acting like a hotel. Fortunately, Jennifer Thomas came through and reminded Dez of the rental space Michelle Falsetta has.

As soon as that door opened, and I was greeted, it was obvious how genuine of a person Dez is. She was impressed with the match layout enough that she offered it to be recorded for free (accepted of course). Like a great heel, Dez worked me over good with body slams, backbreakers, Boston crabs, and camel clutches With me only being 5&#039;2, at one point, she used a Texas cloverleaf to drag my face all over the mat. I requested for her to give me chops. Boy, did she! All three of them I felt reverberate down to my stomach, lol! I got my licks in, but in the end, Dez put me away with a perfect Tombstone.

As a pro wrestling fan, I appreciated Dez&#039; feedback. She was amazed that I&#039;d never done pro wrestling training before. I believe what made the experience even better was that since her next session wasn&#039;t until 9, after the match, we sat, watched some of the WWE Money in the Bank PPV/PLE that was going on, and just picked each other&#039;s brains about the industry.

I can&#039;t say enough great things about Dez, very sweet and genuine. My only regret is I should&#039;ve been &quot;Dezmerized&quot; a while ago. Better late than never.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Saw Dez for the 3rd time recently in Pittsburgh in May.  Our first meeting was in 2019.  I have seen approx 45 ladies over the last 25 years.  I concentrate on seeing the girls that advertise and provide competitive sessions that are also fun and challenging.  Dez is the leader of the pack in this regards. She has amazing skills, good size and strength, beautiful looks, and incredible personality and spirit.  We are well matched for size, and wrestling skills but she has the added element of being a highly skilled BJJ and MMA practitioner.  I pride myself on being able to hang with just about every lady I have seen over the last 25 years, even the 2019 version of Dez.  But I have been humbled and dominated pretty convincingly by Dez in our most recent 2 meetings in last 7 months.  But had a great time even in defeat.  She is an awesome lady with an incredibly diverse background and She is at the top of the food chain for anyone wanting to go competitive and experience what a high level athletic lady can do on the mats.  Without similar size, experience and stamina, I doubt u r going to have much success.  But u will have fun, as long as u are not trying to prove anything and treat her with the respect she deserves.  Just leave your male ego at the door and enjoy the ride and experience.  Don’t wait, as she is transitioning out of the session world at end of this year if things go as she is planning.  And A+ lady and experience.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Well, I couldn&#039;t expect to go undefeated against Dez forever.  She rolled me up and pinned me after a hard-fought session, where we each used our pateneted finisher twice. Only the second session match I&#039;ve lost, but if I&#039;m going to lose to anyone, there&#039;s no one better than Dez Desire.  I bought her a superhero outfit for the match, and she looked absolutely great wearing it!  Guys, you&#039;d better be in shape and up for a real challenge if you  choose to session with her, and you&#039;d better do it fast as she will no longer be doing them after 2024.  That will be a tremendous loss to the mixed session world to lose someone so well skilled, trained, strong, knowledgeable, and just an all-around terrific person!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Over the last two months, I have been fortunate to session twice with my favorite session wrestler, Dez Desire, when she was in Baltimore and Atlanta. After I had a couple sessions with her a few years ago, I decided that I wasn’t going to session with other ladies since I am so enamored with Dez. She is a beautiful woman and even more of a knock out when you are with her in person. I love tall athletic women and she covers those criteria at 5’10” with superior athletic skills. 

One of the other reasons I enjoy my time with Dez is that in addition to her beauty, she is a lovely person who comes across as positive and upbeat. I was late for my session with her in December having got lost in Baltimore. Dez was cool about me arriving 15-20 minutes late. My tardiness definitely upset me more than it seemed to bother her. I know that for session ladies time is money so I was apologetic when I did arrive late. Plus, I don’t think it is good form to be late to a session during which one’s skilled opponent can beat one up if she wanted to do that.

Dez knows how to make a guy feel good about himself. It’s wonderful to be with a beautiful woman and even better when that woman instills confidence in you. I have gotten to know her better over the last few years which has made me appreciate the time I spend with her even more. I doubt if there is a sweeter woman in the session wrestling world than Dez. Since I do consider her a friend, I want the best for her and would definitely go out of my way to help her if she needed my assistance.

Dez’s technical skills are superb. I have a background in high school wrestling so I still have some knowledge of grappling. I am a few inches taller and about 30 pounds heavier than Dez. None of the above helps me when I match up with Dez on the mats. I have found it impossible to take her down from a standing position with either a single or double leg takedown. Her legs are very strong and her center of gravity closer to the mat than mine. A few times, I was fortunate to catch her leaning one way with an upper body move—we called it a “pancake” in high school wrestling—that allowed me to take her down. That may work on Dez maybe once or twice during the session.  She picks up quickly on this move and towards the end of the session she countered with a move of her own that allowed her to turn the tables on me. 

Dez enjoys the rough and tumble of grappling. We bumped heads a few times and fell awkwardly (me much more so than her) and Dez laughed it off. She told me that she enjoys that sort of physicality in a session. She is much better prepared to dish out physical punishment than I am since she is trained and competes in mixed martial arts (MMA). A few sessions ago, I realized that in a competitive MMA match, she would destroy me. I came to this conclusion at a point in time when I was on top and Dez was playfully faking punches to my head—“pow, pow, pow…”

In my last session with her, she decided to “bear hug” me a few times and throw me down on the nearby bed. She is definitely the strongest woman with whom I have sessioned. What makes her the best is how she finishes her holds and offensive moves. In my first few sessions with her, she showed me that in jiu-jitsu being down with one’s back on the mat is an opportunity to use one’s legs as weapons against one’s foe. In high school wrestling that was definitely not a position in which the wrestler had the advantage. I learned the hard way that Dez could use her legs to easily counter any wrestling moves that I was trying on her. Once she got her legs around by midsection or neck that was all she wrote. It is quite the humbling experience to have to repeatedly tap out to an opponent who is smaller but stronger, more agile and skilled enough to kick your ass when she wants to do that. 

I am a US history buff. I have a special affinity for the 19th century military history including the Civil War. Dez is of Native American heritage. I told her that she reminds me of a fierce Native American warrior. The reason she has been successful in MMA is that she is confident in her abilities. I admire her for her athleticism and how she has dedicated herself to becoming an MMA fighter. It is sad that after 2024 we will no longer have the chance to session with Dez. I think the MMA world needs to look out for Dez when she sets her sights on winning championships.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[After being scammed, I was initially hesitant to schedule another session with a traveling wrestler. However, I&#039;m glad to say I was proven completely wrong. My experience with Dez was a complete 180-degree turn. Right from the beginning, Dez displayed utmost professionalism in her communication; she shared her location and room number without any objections.

When it came to the wrestling itself, I&#039;m at a loss for words. Dez is not just beautiful but also incredibly strong and toned. Her wrestling techniques put me in positions that I struggle to describe, and I know I&#039;ll be feeling sore for days to come. I&#039;m eagerly anticipating round two and can&#039;t wait to experience her domination session again.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Sessioned with Dez again this week.  Despite a few drops and imperfections, mostly on my part, we had fun and neither of us got hurt.  She&#039;s very accommodating and pleasant, and can still make a session work even with a few slip ups and mishaps.  Need to be in shape to take her on, because she knows her stuff and can hold her own with most men, let alone women.  If you really want a challenge, I&#039;d strongly recommend her.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I finally saw Dez Desire after a number of times we were not able to meet because of bad timing.  I recently started watching Dez&#039;s intergender matches and I became so hooked on them. She has an electrifying display of strength and stamina in the ring.  Please watch her wrestling matches under Desi Derata.  This woman should be in the WWE!!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Sessioned with Dez for the first time today.  I have to admit I was considerably nervous because she is somewhat bigger and heavier than all the girls I&#039;ve sessioned with previously as well as being one of the tallest.  She is extraordinarily sweet, kind, patient, professional, and accommodating.  She was very helpful in trying to work around some mistakes that I made preparing for the session.   I did everything in my power to be respectful and a gentleman because she is a true professional who deserves nothing less from her clients.  She is just as adept at taking holds as well as giving them, and trusted me to give her a potentially very dangerous finishing hold twice.  Simply put, she&#039;s great!]]></description>

She is extraordinarily sweet, kind, patient, professional, and accommodating.  She was very helpful in trying to work around some mistakes that I made preparing for the session.   I did everything in my power to be respectful and a gentleman because she is a true professional who deserves nothing less from her clients.  She is just as adept at taking holds as well as giving them, and trusted me to give her a potentially very dangerous finishing hold twice.  Simply put, she&#8217;s great!</p>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve been doing session wrestling with combat ladies for the past 13 years and Dez is the strongest that I&#039;ve ever met. From the moment we met she has been absolutely sweet.
I helped her lay down the mat and then we started. 
Two minutes into the session and I realized that I could never beat this girl. All my attempts to take her down failed. She stood firmly and then took me down and put me in various submission holds that I&#039;ve never experienced before. She is an MMA fighter so I was expecting her to be strong but not this strong; she severely out matches me.
If you guys wanna find out the situation you will be in if you get into a cage with this girl, definitely book an appointment with her.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[About a month ago I had the amazing pleasure of meeting Dez for our third session.  What is amazing about this woman, all three sessions I have had with her have been top-10 sessions for me and all three have been so different then the next.  Our first time was moderately paced, neither of us up a high-speed adventure so it was perfect, the second time was high speed from the jump and went hard for 60 minutes straight the last.... the last...slow methodical and poignant. She understands how the body works fluidly together, and when needed to be kept in line she can make the slightest adjustment with the daftest touch and slow you on a dime.  She knows every point to make you miserable in pain, and every one that makes you feel amazing.  She has the kindest eyes, the most calming presence, and loving spirit.  She is an amazing human being that is simply one of the favorite people in the world to spend time with.  The fact that she is gorgeous beyond words is simply the largest cherry on top ever.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This past Monday I saw Dez for the time.  I am not really into competitive or even semi-competitive sessions, but there is something about this woman&#039;s energy that is unmatched.  She walked up to me with the most loving and welcoming smile in the world, but when it was go time, that turned into a devilish grin reminding of her pedigree.  She is a profession MMA fighter, a pro style wrestler and more things then I can list on this review.  Above all she is a kind, caring and loving human being.  I even commented to her, before we we&#039;re even done, that I was trying to figure out how in the world I was going to see her again, and when I could make it happen.  No matter what you are looking for in a session she is game to try it our (as long as you honor her boundaries.)  I know I have written enough but words could never full express what I feel for this woman.  Treat Dez right and you will always be left with a smile on your face.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I just booked a beat down kickboxing session with Dez today. I have done sessions all over the world and I’d say that she is hands down one of the best. She excels at everything from her communication to her actual fighting skills. It’s not easy to find a girl that can be beautiful and still know how to actually fight. Dez really knows how to deliver an amazing session and she does so with her great personality. She’s so easy to talk to and makes you happy to be around her. I cannot recommend her enough.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I must tell this - it never happened to me that 3 weeks after the session I’m still in high about it. To make a long story short, Dez is amazing, she’s beautiful- much more than in photos, the perfect personality for a session wrestler, dominant ,amazing trash talk and obviously super strong and skilled. She’s probably the only one that I’ll take a long flight just to see her again. Very unique in so many ways and One of the best if not the best session wrestlers in the world today.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I saw Dez last night for the first time.  I had met her a few times at different events, but this was the first time I had seen her for a session.  Dez is absolutely gorgeous, there is something about her presence that simply exudes acceptance and just a welcome feeling.  Honestly being with her is so comfortable it is unreal.  Stunning, statuesque and simply amazing.  Her personality is amazing as well, she is sweet, kind and caring.  I really did not know what to expect from our time together, I am pretty laid back and go with the flow and she is an amazing athlete that told me one of her greatest traits is adaptability.  Going with the flow plus adaptability seems like an interesting recipe for a session...and she knocked this one out of the park.  What played out for the hour and change I was there for was exactly what I needed last night.  She is very in tune with what is going on with her body and has the ability to do that with yours as well.  I am roughly 5 months post-op from a rotator cuff surgery and she was careful around my arm and attentive to soreness and tightness I presented.  As we where parting ways all I could think of was &quot;when is the next time I get to see this woman.&quot;  It is hard to put into words how much I respect, adore and desire to be around this woman.  Dez is one of a kind and having the word Desire in her name is perfect....I simply desire to be around Dez.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Sessioned with Dez in Vegas not too long ago. Second time in about a year and WOW, it just gets even better. 

Dez arrived wearing a little black dress and her high heels had her towering at 6&#039;2&quot;. She gave me a nice tight hug and lifted me effortlessly and had me pinned against the wall. &quot;Miss me?&quot; she tauntingly teased as she held me in a front piggy / bear hug, before spinning around and throwing me down on the bed and pinned me so I couldn&#039;t move while she kept teasing me as she flexed her biceps.

I asked for a demonstration of MMA moves. She obliged, and I was twisted up in all sorts of immobile positions &quot;This is how I would break your arm, if I wanted to&quot;. Then I was laid out in a grapevine... &quot;This is how I would break your legs&quot;. She then continued to show off and lifted me all sorts of ways and hardly broke a sweat. 

We alternated between me getting picked up and used as her workout weight, and getting pinned down on the bed unable to move unless I obeyed her commands and set me free. Thank you for another amazing time, Dez! You are an amazing person and you are as beautiful as you are strong.]]></description>
