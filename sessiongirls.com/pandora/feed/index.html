					<description><![CDATA[Maybe a very late review of my 3rd session with Pandora - or maybe a sign of panic when I thought she might have retired. 
I&#039;m writing this since I have seen Pandora&#039;s profile back online here.. Yea baby, the Bikini Queen, the mighty pocket rocket is ready to kick more ass. 
Anyway, Pandora kicked my butt twice in very memorable sessions. 
So a few months ago when I booked my third session with her I was not sure what to expect. 
For sure, Pandora meets her boys in a friendly way.
Then after you get relaxed she disappears only to reappear before you in a  hot bikini.
Geez, any thought I had of wrestling vanishes as I see her casually walk into the room. 
So as this happened on my 3rd session I blurted out &quot;please start off easy&quot; 
Pandora looked surprised  and said &quot;are you afraid of me?&quot;
Before I could answer she pulled me onto the bed and in a few seconds had me trapped in a reverse head scissor. 
After a few seconds I knew it was game, set and match for Pandora. She made me tap twice but after  she released me she scrambled and I found myself trapped in a figure four .......on and own it went until she caught me in some type of triangle choke. Maybe it was a reverse triangle.(?) but i was trapped and as  hard as I tried for a few minutes I couldn&#039;t escape. 
So I said. &quot;I can&#039;t escape, but you cant make me tap&quot;
A proud  moment for me until Pandora instantly adjusted her position and suddenly I couldn&#039;t breath and felt like my head was gonna pop of my body. 
I wasn&#039;t t knocked out but like in our previous sessions Pandora had me somewhere between heaven and hell. 
I guess I wrote enough but am happier than I can say at the chance of a fourth wrestling session with Pandora,

PS - No , I am not afraid of you because your wrestling domination is  also at the highest professional level. You may beat me and hurt me but never injure me.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I was luck enough to session with Pandora while she was here for the holidays. I couldn&#039;t believe how much stronger she has gotten. Not to mention more beautiful and I don&#039;t know her trick but she looks younger as well. That aside I sessioned with her yesterday and my neck is still throbbing. I wish I was exaggerating but I&#039;m not. Her legs are ridiculously strong. I just can&#039;t get over how someone so petite can be that strong. I tried escaping all the wrestling holds she got me in and it was no use. All she did was giggle and remind me she was in control. If you ever are lucky enough that she is in your area I can&#039;t express enough that you must session with Pandora!! Happy Holidays and Happy New Year!!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Just had a fantasy wrestling session with Pandora and couldn&#039;t be happier. She was as advertised stunning, and legs like vice grips. She had me begging for release over and over again, all the while laughing at me.
She was a blast to role-play with as i had requested she met every detail.
I recommend you set up a session with her when she&#039;s in your town you won&#039;t be disappointed.  And very easy to communicate with and set up.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I just had a session with Pandora in Springfield, Ma. and it was super fantastic.  She has extensive experience as a session wrestler and will have a session which matches your preference.  I am a beginner who likes the beginner type &quot;fantasy style&quot; session and she is great at that. If someone prefers the &quot;competitive&quot; type of wrestling session Pandora is also great at that type of session based on her years of experience and technical wrestling and jiu-jitsu skills.  Our session was so much fun and time flew by so quickly.  Besides that she is such a super nice woman who has a friendly bubbly personality.  In summary I highly recommend Pandora for anyone looking to schedule a session.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Pandora made my short list of women I wanted to session with after I saw her in beatdown videos with boxing gloves. She had really good form for jabs, crosses and hooks and I wanted to be face to face but in a semi competitive fight.

I emailed Pandora while I was travelling near her in New Jersey. She did respond, and while she was booked and going from one city to another, she agreed to meet me at 7:30 the next morning for a quick session before she left. I was so glad she did.

She arrived and changed into some black boxing trunks and athletic bra, I provided the handwraps and gloves and and helped her put them on. I started the timer and we were off. While we were trading punches she asked me, &quot;Why are you smiling?&quot; Well, I guess because I had this beautiful athletic woman in front of me boxing with me. Who wouldn&#039;t be smiling?

I didn&#039;t have to prompt her, we had agreed in no hard head punches (just love taps to show you were open) and her punches were on target and just the right power to keep it challenging but not brutal. I had told her before we began that I really like clinching and dirty boxing tactics to the point of almost brawling. She heard that and was all over me. Stepping on my foot and hitting, hitting in clinches and after the bell. She was a fast learner.

The timer counted out 12 rounds and we were done, and she seemed disappointed. She said we can&#039;t end a fight like that when she didn&#039;t hear it was the last round, so we did a 13th round, I put on headgear and she took out all the stops. Lefts, rights, roundhouses and haymakers, all being stuffed into those last few minutes. I didn&#039;t go down but I think she was being kind for this first session and eased up but kept it challenging.

This was probably one of my favorite sessions in the 7 years I have been doing this and while she is moving on to other states on her schedule, we both were sure we would go out of our way to cross paths again someday soon.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I just had my first session with Pandora and it was amazing. I first must say how friendly she is and made the experience so much fun. She is a great conversationalist which helps also. She has an incredible body and as you all can tell she is beautiful. Now to the match. I can&#039;t believe how strong her legs are. I tapped many times. Did I mention her scissors are ruthless. I definitely recommend having a session with her. Thanks again for a great session!!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[What a woman. Small yet so powerful she will ko you or having you tapping out in no time. 
I have had several sessions with her and enjoyed every second 
Great and strong legs that I think they have steel cables in them. A body without any fat. 
Great trash talker. Sorry she is on the west coast. I canâ€™t win my championship belt back ( like I have a chance)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve been doing for quite some time now and I can say for certain that every lady that I have shared the mats with have been absolutely amazing! This time will prove no different. There are some differences that made this time Prodigious Pandora the most unique session ever! I wasn&#039;t certain about the outcome this meet. I was sure of one thing, I definitely left with a story! So how did it go with this Petite Powerhouse named Pandora? Well, I hope you don&#039;t mind that I share.

First, allow me to say this lady is quite mighty! Do I mean for size... NO! I mean MIGHTY, period! I reference this a testament to not only her physical strength (even though she has PLENTY of it!) I&#039;m more so referencing her strength of character. At the risk of improper decorum on my end, Pandora has experience a lot of &#039;instability&#039; in her life currently. Without an unnecessary dive into detail I attempted to book her at a very busy time. She didn&#039;t respond immediately but this was okay. After all, WE ARE HUMAN! However, she soldiered and fought her way through the muck and mire to book our session. Once we booked we were locked in! I was so glad that we were still able to meet! And I couldn&#039;t stand in judgment because I was the one who late to our session. She picked quite the location too, right in the middle of downtown. Parking was a challenge but I knew exactly where I was going, I didn&#039;t even need the GPS! We met and share some great conversation! We even finished an episode of The Office, that&#039;s was how relaxed she contoured the environment. I was definitely as ease. So far, so good!

And now, the business end of our time! We stretched out for several minutes and limbered up! I will spare the details upon what we wrestle on but I&#039;ll just say it was both elevated with confined close quarters. (Let that swirl into the imagination.) LOL! As I stated before Miss Pandora is MIGHTY! All 5&#039;1&quot; and 115 Pounds, all muscle! She wasn&#039;t bulging out of the seams, no it was all functional strength! Amazing! If now if her strength was the only thing I had to be aware it would make an exciting bout, but the fact she also as flexible as a elastic band and quick as lighting too. It&#039;s those attributes that earn her the name: Pandora. The only true advantage I had over her was years of formal training. Even then she had some BJJ and grappling training from a Carlson Gracie Jr. That&#039;s a BIG Deal! So while this match was absolutely fun, I in no way, shape, underestimated her skills and experience! In our scrambles we had to work around our environment and we kept each other safe throughout the times we wrestled. Were there submissions, yes. I pulled off an Americana and a Head and Arm Triangle hold. My highlight though happened at the beginning of the match where I hooked a near perfect Kimura arm hold. Pandora being as tough as she is was reluctant to concede as I lock and twist slowly, she eventually taps. But this would not be a shut out my friends as she pulled off a deep vice grip leg scissors on my neck. Her highlight would also come at the beginning as she must&#039;ve notice the I blinked and at that very moment she charged and applied one of the fastest Rear Naked Choke I ever had locked in on me. I tapped almost immediately it was so fast. Wow! 

Now as amazing as our match was, and it was EXTRAORDINARY! What made our time wonderful was my discovery of a kindred soul. We are both Storytellers! And she has volumes from her years of experience in session wrestling, fighting, bartending, family feuds, travel destinations, past relationships, martial arts, etc. She as down to earth as they come. Finally, I have yet to met a woman that so comfortable in her quirkiness. I mean she finally embrace awkwardness. A woman truly unafraid to be her true self. Outstanding! 

Pandora, this Petite Powerhouse Packed full of Surprises comes with my Highest Recommendation! Book her whenever the opportunity comes! However, I will inform on what to expect when you open Pandora&#039;s box [Pause]. Expect the Truly, Positively UNEXPECTED! Thank you so much Pandora! Cheers to you!]]></description>

It&#8217;s those attributes that earn her the name: Pandora. The only true advantage I had over her was years of formal training. Even then she had some BJJ and grappling training from a Carlson Gracie Jr. That&#8217;s a BIG Deal! So while this match was absolutely fun, I in no way, shape, underestimated her skills and experience! In our scrambles we had to work around our environment and we kept each other safe throughout the times we wrestled. Were there submissions, yes. I pulled off an Americana and a Head and Arm Triangle hold. My highlight though happened at the beginning of the match where I hooked a near perfect Kimura arm hold. Pandora being as tough as she is was reluctant to concede as I lock and twist slowly, she eventually taps. But this would not be a shut out my friends as she pulled off a deep vice grip leg scissors on my neck. Her highlight would also come at the beginning as she must&#8217;ve notice the I blinked and at that very moment she charged and applied one of the fastest Rear Naked Choke I ever had locked in on me. I tapped almost immediately it was so fast. Wow! </p>
<p>Now as amazing as our match was, and it was EXTRAORDINARY! What made our time wonderful was my discovery of a kindred soul. We are both Storytellers! And she has volumes from her years of experience in session wrestling, fighting, bartending, family feuds, travel destinations, past relationships, martial arts, etc. She as down to earth as they come. Finally, I have yet to met a woman that so comfortable in her quirkiness. I mean she finally embrace awkwardness. A woman truly unafraid to be her true self. Outstanding! </p>
<p>Pandora, this Petite Powerhouse Packed full of Surprises comes with my Highest Recommendation! Book her whenever the opportunity comes! However, I will inform on what to expect when you open Pandora&#8217;s box [Pause]. Expect the Truly, Positively UNEXPECTED! Thank you so much Pandora! Cheers to you!</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Just had Round 2 with Pandora! Scheduling was easy, and she is very good with communications about date, time, and location. Pandora gave me an awesome ab workout with her belly punching and trampling and let me worship her smooth, soft feet and rock hard abs at the end of the session as a reward for enduring the punishment! Looking forward to Round 3!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I had the pleasure of having a lift and carry session with Pandora.  One word to some it it up is wow!!  For a 110lb girl she is amazingly strong.  I weigh about 205lb and she carried me around and made it look easy.  Pandora is the newest member of my Century Club which is no easy task. 

Pandora has a great personality and competitive spirit which is awesome.  She is very friendly, easy to get along with and not a clock watcher.  She might be small, but has crazy strength for  her size.  She is very responsive and had no problems with the few requests I had asked her to do for our session.  I would definitely recommend her if she comes to your area and is available.  I had a great time with her.]]></description>

Visiting Philly and knew I had to dedicate some time to be underâ€¦â€¦ i mean wrestle* her.Goddess pandora made me feel comfortable in only a couple mins and we discussed briefly my match (facesitting, smothering, armpits, head scissors, etc).

					<description><![CDATA[I had an awesome belly punching/trampling/foot worship/belly worship session with Pandora! Communication and booking went very smoothly. Pandora has a fun and energetic personality. She is super fit and athletic, with great abs and biceps! You can feel her strength when taking a punch/knee/stomp from her. Amazing experience overall!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://sessiongirls.com/pandora/#comment-3492&quot;&gt;dtigers196884&lt;/a&gt;.

great review- i had a similar experience as I thought i was big enough that &quot;little pandora&quot;  could not hurt me or make me tap out,  Geez, this girl almost killed me and I was thankful when she brought me a water bottle and gently slapped my face to help me regain consciousness  after our first session. Perhaps underrated, but Pandora is the Queen of figure 4&#039;s...... hard to believe .......but she put me in so many different figure 4&#039;s that I was was begging for mercy. I have sessioned for many years and rate Pandora at the top of my experiences. ( Tip - don&#039;t mention she is little or you will suffer) !!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Just finished a great scissors session with Pandora. Very strong and powerful scissors for her size. Just when I thought Pandora couldnâ€™t increase the pressure of her scissors, she did just that. Great at talking trash to her helpless victim. Will definitely session with Pandora again. Thank You Pandora!!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[For me, Pandora is a dream come true: cute, sweet, funny, sassy, and confident. And strong as an ox! I&#039;m twice her size and she completely dominated me, wore me out after 10 minutes of arm-wrestling, tests of strength, and submission wrestling. From that point on I lost count of the number of submissions and she just kept going like the Energizer bunny, and the more I struggled the more she teased me. I loved every minute of it! Do yourself a favor and schedule some time with this petite and powerful Amazon. You will not be disappointed.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I got the chance to meet and do a mini-session with Pandora last night at WAOFIRE event.  She is very easy to talk to and is more beautiful in person.  We did a competitive wrestling session.   Even though I was about twice her size, she was very competitive and well trained.   I was surprised by her leg strength.  I can&#039;t wait to session with her again.  If you get the chance to session with Pandora, take it.  You won&#039;t forget it.]]></description>
