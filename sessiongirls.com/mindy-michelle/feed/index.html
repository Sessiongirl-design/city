					<description><![CDATA[I had a 2-hour session with Mindy this week and it was nothing short of spectacular. Communication was top-notch. We both suffered from a couple of medical issues at the time, so we went with a fantasy session. Her skin is like ivory, just beautiful. We wrestled for 90 minutes ( she was topless), and she spent the last of our session working out the knots in my back. She knows a lot of holds, and truly loves what she does. I can&#039;t recommend her enough.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I found Mindy to be very accommodating in setting up and playing out my fantasy wrestling/dom session. She is patient and a good listener. While you might not think she is drop dead gorgeous when she comes to the door. I was pleasantly surprised, once she got into her session dress how well she carries 185lbs on her 5&#039;11&#039;&#039; frame. She had excellent hygiene, smelled good and has a nice ass. She is an excellent choice for a face sitting session. Pleasent person to work with.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Wrestled Mindy three times now. She&#039;s an outstanding grappler and very dominant! She is knowledgeable and quite strong. If she mounts you...well you&#039;ll be sat on for a while because she&#039;s hard to move from a dominant position. I let her mount me and had to tap as she just sat there with a dominant look on her face knowing I couldn’t escape the position. Watch out for her scissors as her legs are super strong. If you don&#039;t tap then you&#039;ll be napping. I saw stars a few times as she drove my face into her thick bootie to really make her point. She&#039;s super sweet and very pleasant. She has a comfortable place with sweet mats for wrestling. I highly recommend her to anyone!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Mindy and I wrestled in Vegas a few years ago.   She’s friendly and quick to respond and we met at her hotel.   She was topless which she used to her advantage.   I was quickly taken into several bearhugs which she used to drain me.   When the bearhug wore me down enough she got on top and used her breasts and some grinding to take me out completely.   Super fun time and recommend to anyone.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This review is LONG overdue. I first met Mindy back in 2017 when I flew her out to Austin, TX for a 3-day &quot;scissorfest.&quot; Let me assure you - this festival of constrictive prowess was nothing short of magnificent! The first time she wrapped her silky smooth thighs around my neck - fresh off the plane at her hotel - I was immediately enthralled with the &quot;squeezing symphony&quot; of her leg muscles coiling around my throat. It felt so comforting... almost like a firm, motherly embrace... however, soon after I realized that the pressure continued to build far beyond my expectations - and my neck was being squeezed with the force of a python about to consume it&#039;s prey. Mindy will stop if you tap out, but I have a death wish most days and want to truly experience the full power of a scissor goddess. This very first neckscissor certainly was so tight, and held for so long at 100% pressure for over a minute, that my eyelids and forehead were covered in bursted blood vessels that looked quite freaky. That has happen before when I am facing the loins, but NEVER from facing towards the feet! And those highly geometrically arched feet... my goodness what a view when they are covered in nylon and hooked tightly together. I brought her out to Austin once more where we played in the pool, and she bodyscissored me at every angle underwater, haha. As I mentioned before, her squeeze force endurance is quite unusual - so it was quite an experience being bodysqueezed completely breathless knowing if she did not stop, I would have passed out!!! I moved out to Phoenix later that year, and we played a few more times where she kept getting stronger and stronger. I plan on bringing her back to Austin again very soon now that I am here again. Very reliable, VERY SWEET, and has such a kind, nurturing voice. But those LOOOOOOOOOOOONG strong thighs of hers will swiftly seduce your oxygen to her bidding. I just spoke to her yesterday - I&#039;m getting so excited to see her again!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve had the honor and privilege of knowing and competing with Mindy since May 2019. She is approachable, easy to chat with, funny, down to earth, and so much more. When we met for our first match on May 23, 2019, at her place in the Phoenix suburbs, I was excitedly nervous (or nervously excited -- both apply), yet she made me feel comfortable about our upcoming time together. We talked about what I wanted from our session and along the way she threw in some extras that were phenomenal! Afterwards, we gave each other big hugs and thanked the other for a wonderful time. To this day, Mindy and I still chat, banter, and playfully battle. She is a dear friend and one I cherish highly. Definitely take the opportunity to compete against her!]]></description>

To leave a review such as this with many details that are unnecessary is unworthy. I had reviews before the website changed. You are exaggerating your “ideas” just the way that Amber heard did and it is not in anyway the truth. You need to remember who you’re reviewing for and why- and name dates. I have no proof of this. I’m not violent and to be honest I wish you well in your endeavors. Stop fucking with people and maybe you won’t get ignored. You have a bad energy about you. You’re literally the only “psycho” that would leave a review such as this. Please get yourself a mental evaluation and an energy check.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Since no reviews, I decided to risk it and take one for the team.  Massive mistake.  After confirming the appointment she has me drive to a gas station near her location and call again.  I do so and no answer so I leave a discreet voice mail.  I try again in 15 minutes with same results.  After 45 minutes I try again and she finally picks up.  She doesn&#039;t apologize or anything but she tells me she&#039;s having a bad day and isn&#039;t sure she wants to have the session that day and to call her back in an hour.  I should mention I drove 45 minutes to get there and it&#039;s Phoenix and 105 degrees out and I&#039;m sitting in my car all this time.  I should have known better but I drove 45 minutes and I had already waited over 45 mins so I went to a McDonalds where at least it was cool and had lunch and drank about 5 diet cokes and called her back an hour later.  Again she doesn&#039;t pick up until 2 tries and 30 mins later.  So now it&#039;s 2 and a 1/4 hours I&#039;ve been waiting and 3 hours since I left home and she tells me she still isnt sure she is feeling like she wants to do it and maybe if I call back in another hour she will feel more into it.  So I tell her I can&#039;t wait another hour and I&#039;m not looking for anything stressful and can she please just do the session now since I&#039;ve been waiting over 2 hours and she totally goes off on me and tells me that I&#039;ve caused her to have a panic attack and now she won&#039;t be able to session all day and to never call her again, and she hangs up on me.

As bizarre as this all may sound, it doesn&#039;t even begin to capture the tone of her voice and the way she phrased her words.  This woman is seriously mentally ill, and possibly in a violent sort of way.  I don&#039;t know if she has actually ever seen a client or not, and tend to doubt it after talking with her and the lack of prior reviews, but I highly recommend staying far away from this maniac.]]></description>
