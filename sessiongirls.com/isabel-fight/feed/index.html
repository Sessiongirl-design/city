					<description><![CDATA[I had the pleasure of meeting Isabel for a session. She&#039;s an open, vibrant person. It was a great feeling to talk to her about her experiences with wrestling. I&#039;ve always looked at her as one of the fundamental people FD is built on.  She has a lot of feisty energy, which she quickly showed me on the mats. She has a style of wrestling that I love. Stubborn, doesn&#039;t like to give up, uses the full force of her body. I was surprised by her strength, especially her thighs, the power of which is really overwhelming. 
It was one of the best sessions I&#039;ve ever had.
Finally, I would like to mention the reliability and friendliness. Isa kept on time and came the long way across the country to my city. Which I also really appreciate about her.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I recently contacted Isabel to try to set up a catfght between her and another girl. To my surprise she was in contact with Monique from Fighting Dolls. Monique has been my all time favorite catfighter from that company since I discovered her. So needless to say I was beyond excited when she let me know that she was able to set up a catfight between herself and Monique. Isabel was very professional, kind and responded to my emails in a very timely manner. And after a few days I received an email from her with the catfight attached. Seeing Monique in action again was great!!! Both women looked great and the catfight was top notch! I&#039;m not gonna go into great detail about the fight but if you&#039;ve seen a FD video before then you know what you can expect. On a scale of 1-10 I would give this an 11!!!! Thanks Isabel and Monique for a stunning catfght!!!!]]></description>
