					<description><![CDATA[Met Fitness Physique again in London and once more was blown away by her amazing build and beauty. However her qualities are more that just physical, as she has a very warm and genuinely lovely personality. Her English is quite good, as we conversed about her bodybuilding life, experiences and future desires and her passion to better her physique. Within the session, I enjoyed worshipping her renowned peaked large biceps which were matched by her impressive triceps, forearms, quads and calves. Also she overpowered me in pins, armwrestling and other superior shows of strength. A great session which we both thoroughly enjoyed. Can&#039;t wait to meet her again. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f60a.png" alt="😊" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f64f-1f3fc.png" alt="🙏🏼" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f99c.png" alt="🦜" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f618.png" alt="😘" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/2615.png" alt="☕" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f4aa-1f3fc.png" alt="💪🏼" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Met Fitness Physique recently in London and was very, very pleased. She is renowned for her incredibly impressive peaked and developed solid biceps, but the rest of her was equally well developed. Her side biceps pose was exceptional and her calves were especially notable. Her English is good enough for a simple conversation and her beautiful smile and friendly personality made me feel at ease and very comfortable. She is extremely passionate about bodybuilding and wants to continually improve. If you love the look of a truly beautiful, muscular woman, you will not be disappointed. Thank you for meeting me, you are one amazing woman. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f4aa-1f3fc.png" alt="💪🏼" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f4aa-1f3fc.png" alt="💪🏼" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f44f.png" alt="👏" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f60a.png" alt="😊" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f618.png" alt="😘" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f64f-1f3fc.png" alt="🙏🏼" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f99c.png" alt="🦜" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f99c.png" alt="🦜" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />]]></description>
