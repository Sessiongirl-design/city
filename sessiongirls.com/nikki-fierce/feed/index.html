					<description><![CDATA[Had an amazing scissoring session with Nikki. It was my very first session so I was filled with a lot of anxiety and nervousness coming into it but she definitely helped eased me in.
All of her submissions from her headscissors to triangles were so strong and tight. I loved the way she moaned and playfully taunts me while I&#039;m in her hold. I tried not to tap for the longest time but her legs were so strong that I tapped out a couple times and got knocked out twice. She was real kind as she helped me up and handed me my water after the knockouts. She seems to be pretty busy but definitely reommend booking a session with her when you can!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I had an awesome lift and carry session with Nikki.  She boasts that she has ridiculously strong legs from dancing and gymnastics. She is absolutely right and is the newest member of the Century Club. I&#039;m I little over 200lbs and this beautiful little girl pulled off my Century Club challenges like a it was nothing.  I don&#039;t think I even got her to sweat like most girls.  Nikki is truly a red headed beauty and has a competitive to game.  She is real easy to talk to and kept in good communication all the way up to our session.  She is very professional to the point where she almost cancelled on me because she had got a stomach bug and didn&#039;t feel right to try to session if she was not felling 100%.  Lucky for me we where able to find a time that we could get together and she was willing to accommodate that time.  Nikki is fantastic and in my opinion, the total package.  She is extremely beautiful, has a heart of gold, very friendly, professional, has a competitive spirit and is amazingly strong.  Not sure you can ask for much more other than, &quot;Please come to my city...LOL!&quot; I would strongly recommend her for anything she offers and for those who like feet, she has a real pretty pair.  I can&#039;t wait to see her again.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Had to take a minute after my session with Nikki to let it all sink in. This woman is amazing! She was one of my first sessions ever 10 years ago and she has only gotten stronger and more beautiful since. She has amazingly strong scissors and is endlessly creative in the holds she can twist you into. She has incredible control of her muscles and can activate different groups at different levels so even the same hold hits you in different ways. Plus she delivered maybe the most intense knockout I’ve ever experienced!
And even after all of that, I haven’t mentioned her most impressive gifts. While her role play skills are top notch, her best trait is her ability to intuit your interests and desires and incorporate them. There were times when I felt like she was reading my mind, speaking into existence the thoughts racing through my head as she inflicted the next excruciating hold so effortlessly upon me. And that amazing smile of hers as she looks down upon you makes you want to endure all of that and more. 

Do not miss an opportunity with her!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I was lucky enough to be able to go to Boston and have my first ever session, and couldn&#039;t be happier that it was with Nikki. I went in nervous, but it didn&#039;t even take a minute before she had eased all of my nerves. She is kind and genuine, stunningly gorgeous, and has a smile that lights up the room. She made sure I was comfortable and that I understood I was in good hands, so I knew I was in for a blast before we even started. 

Once we started though, I quickly learned that Nikki is much more than just a pretty face. She is deceptively strong and has more than enough skill to twist you into submissions before you even know what&#039;s going on. Even with a distinct size advantage, she repeatedly had me completely locked down and at her mercy. Flowing effortlessly from hold to hold, I was often in a new predicament before I registered what she was doing. Once she had me where she wanted me, she started in with the smack talk, enjoying her dominance over me. Whether I was locked up too tight to get words out or if she had her foot over my mouth, I was often in no position to respond and was left to see how long I could hold out before she inevitably got the tap out of me. The session flew by and left me with a big smile on my face, wanting nothing more than to do it again as soon as she&#039;s back in town.

Two thumbs up, 5 stars, 10 out of 10, whatever rating system you want to use, Nikki is incredible. Playful, sweet, stunning, skilled, and dominant, she&#039;s the total package. Do yourself the favor and book a session with her if you can, I know I will be watching her travel schedule for the opportunity to have her wipe the floor with me again.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Nikki Fierce - My first ever session girl experience! 
Back in 2013, I saw Nikki Fierce on facebook beating up somebody for a production site.  I started joking  back and forth with her about how we should get together for a match and she told me she was coming to Boston in March 2013 and she&#039;d love to put me in place.  We chatted about our love for pro wrestling (we are both huge fans of Roddy Piper) and finally I drove up to Boston and had my first ever session! I thought &quot;Hey i did pro wrestling and i also ride my bike 10 miles to work and back! I should be ok!&quot;  

Lemmie tell you how wrong I was.  Nikki was a sweetheart as soon as she opened the door and though I marked hard for her before we started wrestling on the bed, she QUICKLY showed me how strong and &quot;fierce&quot; she really was!   Her laughter, tattoos, skills, and sweet personality were a sweet and sinster combination of showing me just how much dominance she was able to bring!  

I found out the hard way just how much i needed to work on my flexibility and conditioning.  Since then, Nikki and I had quite a few sessions together, with the last one in 2019 during her &quot;one last tour: and she has never lost a step.  I was fortunate enough to be one of her favorites and I&#039;m glad she took a chance on me when I was new to this industry.  She will always have a place in my heart as being my first session girl experience, no matter what the future holds &#060;3]]></description>
