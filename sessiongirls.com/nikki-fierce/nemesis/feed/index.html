					<description><![CDATA[Last week I had a double session with Nemesis and Venom. This time with them was great. They are both incredible.

The conversation before to fix the session was very uncomplicated and with a friendly and appreciative wording. I was quite nervous because these two ladies are known for their great skills and also very prominent in this business. But from the beginning, from entering the room the nervousness was gone. They greeted me extremely friendly with a nice hug. Nemesis hug was really hard. I got the first imagination of her strength. I like that.

With the beginning of the session itself I was completely beaten up. Nemesis has a big repertoire of submission holds and she seemed to be keen showing me all of them. What surprised me most  was her strenght. She is extremely strong, though in my eyes, sorry Nemesis, she doesn’t look like. But gosh, she can put you to sleep within seconds if she wants. Muscles of steel. Mostly I had to tap within seconds. With her look in her face she can show you how much fun she has. During the session I was completely dominated and destroyed. On top came the trash talk to challenge me doing more, trying to escape, but no chance.
At the end I was completely humiliated. They didn’t let me go, put me in one hold after the other and showed me their superiority. A further humiliating act was the forcing me kissing the feet after they put them on my face and into my mouth. Nemesis was friendly although and was always safe for me feeling okay.

Nemesis is physically very strong and can give you a big show wrestling with her. Besides she is friendly, kind and appreciative. I can highly recommend her and can’t wait myself to meet her again.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I met with Nemesis whilst up in Manchester, and it&#039;s the most fun I&#039;ve had in a long time. I very nearly got Ko&#039;d, but always panicked, but be in no doubt, she has a dangerous pair of legs which she can utilise in a wide range of moves that will put your lights out. Her pins are second to none, and my attempts to shake her off were futile. If you&#039;re lucky enough to be in the North West, be sure to give Nemesis a shout if you need a proper beating. Oh, and she&#039;s a good conversationalist, even when she&#039;s crushing your skull.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Nemesis is a force to be reckoned with. Possibly one of the most technical grapplers I faced. She was in total control throughout the session, forcing numerous and different taps. In previous sessions id always muscled my way out of holds, but I quickly learned once I was forced into guard or mount, it was the beginning of the end and only a matter of time until she found a way to the tap.

She was very fun, friendly and accommodating. A great hang. I wanted a tough session and she gave me that and more. 

Thanks for a great session and I’ll be returning again!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I had the pleasure of meeting Nemesis during my first ever double session, alongside Venom in Paris. I was a bit intimidated at first glance, as per usual, but knowing Venom already made things easier. Nemesis seems to have a fun personality, and alongside her grappling skills it became obvious she likes inflicting pain and being worshipped.
The first holds she put on me were very gentle, pulsing her thighs lightly around my neck. Venom joked she didn&#039;t want to hurt me because I was so young and sweet. It quickly changed though, as it didn&#039;t take long before Nemesis went hard on me, and broke my will and soul with her headscissors. After torturing me for a while with a front headscissor, she smoothmy increased the pressure and made me pass out in seconds. It felt obvious that it wasn&#039;t her first time ^^ Her triangle chokes are special, usually I tap right away because I&#039;m coughing too much, but Nemesis grip on your neck and throat makes the blood run through the veins in your head, and then you feel like it&#039;s going to explode. The most humiliating part is that she said she barely used her strenght to completely annhilate me (about 10-20%).
Even though she still has to find her marks, Nemesis is a very promising sessionist, and I can&#039;t wait to meet her again sooner rather than later!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I had my first ever session with Nemesis just before Christmas. She had a hotel room and met me outside and we walked in together. She was very nice and friendly and made me feel comfortable. She gave me time to get ready as it was raining heavily as I arrived. 

Although she is skilled in jiu jitsu, she hadn’t done much pure scissors before so I explained some of the basic moves like reverse headscissors and figure 4 headscissors etc. 

Within minutes of trying she was natural. Her monstrous thighs coiled around me like an anaconda. Felt like steel wrapped around me. Her body triangle was my favourite as I was left completely helpless. Nemesis also was very good a ko’ing me which was a great experience. 

My neck and chest absolutely ached the next day but was 100% worth it. Hope to see you again next time you visit. Hopefully very soon?<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f91e.png" alt="🤞" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />]]></description>
