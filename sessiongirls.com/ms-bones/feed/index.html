					<description><![CDATA[I had a thoroughly enjoyable first time with Ms Bones the other night - a semi-comp (?) bondage match. She twisted and pinned my arms behind me and lashed them plenty tight before securing me in a hogtie. She gave a good taunting afterwards, making me feel like a pathetic pussy, and generally treated me like a helpless piece of meat before choking me unconscious several times. If this sounds like your idea of a good time, I wholeheartedly recommend a session with her.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Third time session with MS Bones and what a charm! The way she listens and adapts to my needs is the mark of a great person. She is so easy to talk to and truly a people person. With a smile on her face she can be as gentle or rough as you need. Either she&#039;s getting stronger or I&#039;m getting weaker, or both! Her curves are magnificent and something to behold and underneath there are super strong toned muscles, she&#039;s like a boa constrictor. 
I opted to order the combination platter of grapple and domination treatment, but don&#039;t just stick to the menu. She is ready to adapt and was happy to put me through some interesting moves. Again I opted for a bit of rough treatment but that is of course optional. Her repertoire is expanding and her enthusiasm is very engaging.
I am so happy I finally met someone who would help me fulfill my needs and I never expected it to ever happen. MS Bones sounds perfect? Yes she does (I mean is). You should try her sessions, always a great experience!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I had my first session with Ms Bones and it was seriously incredible. She asked me a ton of questions before my session to understand what I was hoping for and what I was expecting. I’m pretty new to this, so she was amazing at asking clarifying questions to try and get more info about me. I was super nervous during my session so I was a bit more reserved than I usually am, but Ms Bones did great at checking in on me to make sure I was still enjoying it. At the beginning of the session, she showed me different implements she wanted to try on me and asked me more questions about some ideas she had that I might like. For a newbie like me, it’s incredible how thorough and knowledgeable she is because I felt safe from the moment I got there. Her skin is SO soft and she smells divine. She was gentle and kind with me when the time called for it, but also firm and strong when I needed it. I am much bigger than her and her pure strength is incredible. I was thinking there’s no way she could handle me being so much bigger than her but she can and she did. She is beyond fierce in every way but still such a lovely and kind human. This felt like a turning point in my sexual exploration and I let her know that when she checked on me the next day. She appreciated the honesty and communication which I thought told me a lot about her.

Overall, I would definitely do it again. I’ve already started thinking about other ideas I’d like to try in our next session.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Today was my first time meeting Ms. Bones. I’m usually pretty nervous when meeting for the first time. she did an excellent job to swiftly make me feel comfortable and ease me into things. 

I would like to start by saying she is even more gorgeous in person! Her radiance is truly a beacon. Communication is key in a session to build trust and ensure a good time for both parties. So when I first arrived we sat and explored further what had been discussed in our emails so that we both were on the same page before beginning . 

This is my first time doing a wrestling session. She made sure to ease me into it and would have me tell her to go harder or lighter so we could find that perfect sweet spot together. Her technique is methodical and you can quickly recognize her training in MA. She had me feeling overwhelmed in the best way possible while remaining vigilant with my well being . 

I can’t recommend Ms. Bones enough if you are thinking about having a session with her. She is friendly, very professional , considerate, strong, and charismatic. overall an excellent time and fun to be around. I will definitely be back !]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Ms Bones took great effort to talk to me about my wishes. She is easy to talk to. Her body is truly a work of art, toned and muscular. I enjoyed her smooth skin and tight grappling restraints. I tried to physically resist but fortunately that was futile. She can be as rough or gentle as you wish and I opted for a bit rougher. She was open to my worship of the female belly and belly button and she threw in some domination action and orders. I look forward more than you could imagine to future sessions. She is a 10. Thank you Ms Bones, I appreciate it.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I met Ms Bones and she proceeded to use me as her puppy. The session included: trampling (including walking on body), humiliation as she had me bark like a dog, sending me to crawl around the room and much more. Ms  Bones also took my limits into consideration. For example: she trampled me without her stilettos. I would rate the session 11 out of 10. Thank you, Ms Bones.]]></description>
