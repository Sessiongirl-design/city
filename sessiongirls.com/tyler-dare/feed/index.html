					<description><![CDATA[Just had my first session with her yesterday. And let me tell you she is strong. Setting up was easy had one set up with in a couple of days of the first email. Met at her place talked about what all was involved and then got right to it. Started out with trying her scissors and smothering techniques. Her legs feel soft resting around your neck. Until she starts squeezing almost full strength then they feel like massive tree trunks is what she described it as afterwards  she had me tapping in seconds. And then was told not even full power and almost had me passing out. Her full power didn’t even take 3 seconds and I was taping. Her smothering was amazing definitely knew how to seal off all my air. And was open to everything I was wanting to do. Definitely will be doing a session with her again soon.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I met Tyler back in 2016 and although my memory of the session is quite fuzzy, I know I had a good time. So when I noticed that she was coming back to my city last month, I instantly contacted her and booked a rematch. It&#039;s like no time had passed since our first meeting. Tyler is so fit it&#039;s unfair, her skin is glowing (and extremely soft, as I&#039;d soon find out), she&#039;s more gorgeous than ever.

We had a nice chat to catch up and then we started wrestling on the kingsize bed of her hotel room. With this kind of setup it&#039;s always hard to assess the competitive ability of your opponent, but that wasn&#039;t my main goal anyway. We had a great back and forth, lots of submission on both sides (ok maybe I tapped a little more often than her... or a lot more often... look, I got her at least a couple times, ok?) and a sneaky and completely painless knockout to top it off.

So if you&#039;re looking for a good tussle with a wonderful lady, do yourself a favor and message Tyler. You&#039;ll spend half your time laughing with her, and the other half asking her nicely not to detach your head from your neck with her headscissors (they&#039;re terrifying, in a good way). I hope I won&#039;t have to wait for another seven years to see her again!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Just finished another session with Tyler, and wow! I think she get stronger between sessions. Tyler is one of those that loves what she does, and it shows. Always positive and full of energy. If you don’t leave your session in a better mood, there is something wrong. Never miss a chance to meet and session with Tyler and see for yourself.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Met Tyler yesterday (2 December) for half hour and then Chloe for another half hour.

OMG she’s amazing! Great communicator pre session, very friendly and bubbly. She made me feel relaxed straight away (I’m introverted and quiet/nervous around people I’ve not met before).

We’d discussed what I wanted beforehand - scissors / facesitting / feet stuff / verbal humiliation etc. she made sure to do it all and did it with plenty of banter and laughter.

She was also very complimentary about my…rainbow mountain…which was a boost to the ego!

She is gorgeous and has a lot of tricks she loves to show off ;)

Next time she’s around I’ll book for longer. What a lovely lovely lady she is!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have been a fan of Tyler Dare for years and am so happy that I got a chance to session with her. I was overjoyed when she called me on the morning of the session to tell me how excited she was to meet me!

Tyler is so energetic and engaging, and she radiates positive vibes! We got along very well as soon as we met. We had so much fun during our session and had some great conversations. Tyler is VERY strong, and she put my abs to the test with solid straight punches and gut-busting single and double hammerfists. She dug her heels DEEP into my abs with stomps and axe kicks that had me worried that I might throw up! (Thankfully, I didn&#039;t!) 

We finished off the session with me worshipping Tyler&#039;s sexy, soft feet and solid, strong core. We had so much fun, and we both wish that the session lasted longer! We agreed that Round 2 MUST happen! Tyler and I had a GREAT session. We had fun conversations, a lot of laughs, and she gave me an amazing ab workout! We will absolutely session together again!

					<description><![CDATA[Don&#039;t know how this review is going to be. It&#039;s because this is the first session I left with unfinished business. I will say that while I very much look forward to concluding say business later. I will unabashed in describing the amazing time I had with the lovely southern belle Tyler Dare. I won&#039;t prolong this one so much as stated our time ended a little early. 

With communication, we were able set up our session in matter of minutes for a next day session. Tyler was incredibly quick on the button. She must&#039;ve been excited to get going! It was also pretty that she chose a location that I was already familiar with in the city. She gave me permission and capability to text her the next day. The day of our session we were able to check in with one other to make sure that we were still confirmed and that we were still able to meet. This is were her 15 Years of Session Experience shined the most! And even with all this due diligence on her part, I was still late ugh! 

Finally we were able to meet, my nerves at this point were at their peak. Once she opened the door and greeted with a smile who&#039;s brightness can match a thousand suns, her flowing red hair and one of warmest hugs I&#039;ve received in a long while! Needless to say my nerves were put at ease. From the time I entered the door until the time I left we engaged in some absolutely amazing conversation! Even in our match, which I will get to later. She pretty much took time to shared almost the entirety of her 15 Year Journey in this Industry! She shared everything from most fun times to some of her most brutal matches. She did all this while keeping the same smile on her face the whole time. It wasn&#039;t forced it was just her overflowing expression of her authentic zest for life! I was absolutely amazed at her energy! So when time came closer to our match I requested that she would dress comfortably, once she unveiled her most comfortable outfit, I had no words just a reaction... &quot;WHOA!&quot; For the sake of discretion and to leave some shroud of mystery I won&#039;t reveal what she wore here. I will say that it displayed one of the most incredible figures I&#039;ve seen from ANY woman in person. A moment of transparency, this made the match a little... I mean WAY more difficult to concentrate. Ha! So once we squared away with the preliminaries we got the business portion of our evening.

I can say with certainty that Ms. Tyler is more than just a beautiful woman with a dynamite figure; she an incredibly capable combatant. She&#039;s pound for pound the strongest woman I know for her frame! Her defensive abilities are a testament to her fifteen years of wrestling experience. She allowed me to attack knowing she can defend whatever comes next. All to show that she has seen it all! She expressed it as much in her in match banter as I heard the constant jeers of &quot;nope, uh uh, try again, NO!&quot; LOL! Which was cool for me, it just allowed me to be more creative. I love it when I have to be more cerebral in a match! I try to always defer to being the thinking man rather than being the strong man in a grapple. I applied the same principle here with Tyler as I performed a back door (pause) maneuver that led me to be able to her back and apply a rear naked choke. To be honest, I caught a luck break and was able to capitalize. This went well into the 30 minute session I have scheduled. When she told me &quot;Time&#039;s Up.&quot; I couldn&#039;t help but to request another 15 minutes. To which she boasted, &quot;can&#039;t get enough huh?&quot; And the truth is... NO! I couldn&#039;t. The next 15 minutes of scramble were just full of force, power, fun, and laughter! After time expired knew then that next time I owe it to her to schedule a multi-hour session the next time we meet. We have unfinished business that I can&#039;t wait for us to address again. She even wanted to arm wrestle me briefly to cap things off. 

Ms. Tyler Dare is everything that I could possibly dream of in a session. The crazy thing was quickly everything happen, from the blazing speed of our set up, to the duration of or time, to how quickly we became friends in the interim. She is just unique in everyway, from her flowing red hair, attractive facial features and this attached to a physique that is virtually, impossibly symmetrical and toned. I would say that it&#039;s stuff of magazine covers or even comic books but they could possibly duplicate what Tyler Dare bring to the table in real life! To describe Tyler Dare in a few words... &#039;One of a Kind.&#039; While yes she possesses one of kind beauty with a one of a kind body, what even more pertinent is her one of a kind spirit and one of a kind of heart. Btw, with an uncanny impression of one of my favorite ladies. Sugar Diamond if you ever read this, Tyler has you down to a science and an art. LMBO! A true North Carolinian Southern Belle who&#039;s unique in every best way possible! She has instantly grown to be one of my favorites! She not only has my highest recommendation but she has my endorsement as well! As stated several times before, we left our session with unfinished business. I&#039;m wait in great anticipation for us to meet again and put everything into a nice bow!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I sessioned with her a couple days ago and I have to say she was absolutely amazing.  Hands down a 10/10.  She&#039;s strong and knows technique and also teaches some technique too.  If you are in her area or she&#039;s traveling to your area do yourself a favor and book her you won&#039;t be disappointed.  Easily one of if not my favorite session ive had.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I had a lift and carry session with Tyler in NY.  Tyler is so wonderful in many ways.  She is very accommodating (within limits), honest, down to earth and strong.  We had such a great time talking,  She is very easy to get along with and makes you feel comfortable the minute you see her. She took to my lift and carry challenges like a boss.  She was disappointed she missed the mark on one of my challenges, but give her circumstances of her first flight being cancelled and just getting in that morning, I think she did amazing doing 65 piggyback squats and Tyler was disappointed in herself for falling short of my challenge. Did I mention I&#039;m 60 pounds heavier then her... she still picked me up easily and was able to piggyback me in 4&quot; heeled boots.  She has amazing calves that pop out of nowhere when she put the heels on. I can&#039;t wait to see her again because she is just so amazing to be around.  I had such a good time with her and would say if she come to your area, you should try booking a session with her, you won&#039;t be disappointed. Tyler also gives the best hugs....]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I had an amazing session with Tyler in New York, we met at the hotel and when she open the door, she made me feel so welcomed. We talked on the bed, go to know each other and from there the session began. We did some bear hugging and catballing and we rolled around for a while and her she was no push over, she was really strong. In most of our rolling around, our bodies were pretty much tangled but once she got you in a head lock, its over. Overall, awesome session, I can&#039;t wait to see her again and she&#039;s so fun and friendly, I highly recommend booking a session with her!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It finally happened! After searching for the majority of my adult life, Tyler became the first girl to ever beat me at arm wrestling! Previously, she had been the closest any had come, when we met 13 years ago. At that point, she held me to a draw...but she told me that she had gotten much better since our first meeting through a lot of practice and specified training...and she was NOT lying! The most surprising thing was that now, I was no contest for her! There was no slow, steady battle with an eventual wearing down...no, she beat me in under 10 seconds...and that&#039;s being generous! (I wish we would have filmed it to see just how quick it was). I thought maybe I wasn&#039;t ready, or our elbows weren&#039;t in the right position or even just a fluke...so we tried two more times with the exact same result! She was giddy and dancing and celebrating as I was in shock at the ease of her victory! I am very glad I decided to get a rematch with Tyler after all these years and very glad for the result! Congratulations again on your victory!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[After seeing Tyler in Chicago, I finally got a chance to session with her today in Philadelphia.   She was so sweet and greeted me with a great big hug.  We had a competitive wrestling session.  She was a lot stronger than she looked.  I kept her from sissoring me for the most part but that didn&#039;t stop her from using her headlock to subdue me.  She was a lot of fun to wrestle and talk to.  If you ever get the chance to session with Tyler, DO IT!! You will love every minute of it.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Long overdue review!
On December 13th 2021 - I had the absolute privilege of finally meeting Ms Tyler Dare for a session.
Just had to add, 
I had no trouble reaching Her. 
She was great with communication up to and even during the session. 
 What an incredible personality! She will make you feel comfortable right away.  She greated me with an enthusiastic hug when we met outside of the elevator. And another one on the ride up to the floor She was on.  I had driven over an hour into the city to see Her, through rush hour traffic and all.  So I was a little frazzled from the rush.   Maybe She picked up on this, as Her hugs melted ALL that anxiety away. 
I couldn&#039;t help but smile from the excitement She had for me being there.   
 The whole time I kept thinking about all the videos I&#039;ve seen of Her over the years.. I was about to actually wrestle the one and only Tyler Dare. 
So, I can&#039;t say enough good things about Her and my experience with Her.. She&#039;s super easy to talk to, as well. It was awesome.
She&#039;s gorgeous... incredibly sexy.. and way stronger than She looks at first glance. (Way stronger)
 I couldn&#039;t believe what it was like to try and transition out after being pinned by Her.. or after I was trapped in Her scissors.   She is very strong and it becomes evident pretty quick. Once She had me, I wasn&#039;t going anywhere unless She let me. 
 I feel lucky to have the privilege of being submitted (repeatedly) by Tyler Dare.. and I can&#039;t wait to do it again when She comes back to Philly.

					<description><![CDATA[I got to meet Tyler for a third time and she has yet to disappoint!
She&#039;s sexy, quirky, and adorable. And she&#039;s incredibly strong! We did a fantasy session and she dominated me and totally threw me around!
She&#039;s also a big sweetheart. She&#039;s warm and fun to talk to. We talked, wrestled, and had a great time.
If you ever have a chance to meet Tyler, don&#039;t pass it up!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I session with Tyler regularly when she comes through town. She is such fun! She gets into your head and has the silkiest scissors I’ve ever experienced. Her outfit selection is extensive and her teasing nature is titillating. Make sure you see her if you’re lucky enough to have her come to your town.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Agreed with Robbly, don’t get any response from Tyler and the only contact info listed is the email. All information provided in email and even will to deposit full amount, maybe not active anymore. Have been getting great sessions on though with other local ladies, hopefully Tyler isn’t retired!]]></description>
