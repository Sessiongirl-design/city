					<description><![CDATA[Wow!!! I had high expectations when I recently met Tomiko, and she far exceeded them! For starters she is absolutely drop-dead gorgeous. And is also punctual, friendly, and incredibly easy and fun to talk to.

Once the match got started, I quickly found out that her legs are just as strong as advertised â€” if not even stronger! Her core strength is out of this world. And her trash talking skills are second to none. I felt so comfortable even as she locked me in one hold after another.

If youâ€™re considering a session with Tomiko, do yourself a favor and DO IT!! One of the best experiences I have ever had. Sheâ€™s a total professional who can kick some serious butt.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[10/10.  The session I had with Tomiko was one my most favorite sessions of all time. Tomiko is awesome.  She is very easy to talk to and engage with. .But make no mistake, when the actions starts she will quickly turn that incredible smile into whatever you want out of session.  Oh, and she&#039;s also very strong so watch out.

I&#039;m looking forward to future sessions.  If you&#039;re reading this, it is in your best interest to initiate contact with Tomiko.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I apologize for not submitting this review immediately after the session.  I had been procrastinating.

When I decided to travel from afar and meet Tomiko, I made the decision to see Tomiko only a few minutes after seeing her profile.  Her natural beauty and natural muscular physique gravitated to me so much.  I was also so impressed by her acting reel and her wrestling matches.  She had a great match with Jen Thomas most recently.  Please watch her wrestling matches!!!  They are packed with excitement.

I traveled to Pittsburgh, PA to see her this past July.  We had a wonderful session.  We talked so much. Watch out for her headlocks!!  

But overall Tomiko is one of the best.  She is in better shape than some young women in their 20s!!!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[On every Vegas Tour I get to spent quality time with Tomiko.  She is an industry favorite who has earned accolades over these many years.  Her style is fresh and light.  She is just stunning in every way, a gorgeous face and well balanced physique.  She sports calves of steel that are just so sexy, accompanied by great feet.  Her thighs are silky smooth and just the right size to neck scissor without threatening the jaw and teeth. Picture her in the Wonder Woman outfit and she is perfectly cast - giving Lynda Carter a run for her money.  Definitely having better legs!!!

Always a mixed session with ballbusting, scissors and some smothering.  I took mental pictures from beneath in various positions so I could remember her forever.  Tomiko is fierce and feminine with a charming personality.  She is a great conversationalist and again can set you at ease.  At this point, its like we&#039;re old friends and she knows just how to position me for a pounding.  Thanks Tommy for another fantastic session!!!!  You are among the all time greats.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[What a fantastic second match with Tomiko!  She was personable, had gear for me to borrow, and delivered the exact session I asked for!  She is as beautiful and strong as ever, by the way.  The match evolved organically and in the end, we knew who the winner was (spoiler: her!).  She is a gracious hostess and a delight to interact with. I can&#039;t wait for round 3 :-)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Got to film with Tomiko during Fetcon. Let me put it this way, I decided to book her for an up to 8-hour shoot when she visits my state in a few months after having completed hour 1 hour shoot. She&#039;s in great shape, has a phenomenal attitude, and looks amazing on camera as well as in person.

She&#039;s quick with communication, transparent, and professional in all respects. Yet as much of a fan as I was of her years before becoming a producer, she even exceeded my expectations for the shoot.

I highly recommend her for shoots and sessions.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Just recently had a session with Tomiko and it was great. Highly skilled and for her size, very strong. Donâ€™t underestimate or you will be in serious trouble - which you probably will be anyway. 

You are really missing out if you donâ€™t give her a try. She has a great personality, and very down-to-earth too. Truly a gold medal session girl!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;span&gt;I just had my first private wrestling session with Tomiko.  She is totally awesome!   I thought I would be a good match for her since I am an athletic personal trainer who works out every day, but I could not submit her, not even once. She made me give up more times than I can count even though I was giving it my all.   Her strength, skill and endurance forced me into intense submissions where I had no choice but to give in to her.   Most of all she&#039;s personable and professional, communicates well and really enjoys the wrestling. Unless you are a bigger and stronger guy with proficient wrestling skills you probably wouldn&#039;t stand a chance either.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;Highly recommended, good luck!&lt;/span&gt;]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span>I just had my first private wrestling session with Tomiko.  She is totally awesome!   I thought I would be a good match for her since I am an athletic personal trainer who works out every day, but I could not submit her, not even once. She made me give up more times than I can count even though I was giving it my all.   Her strength, skill and endurance forced me into intense submissions where I had no choice but to give in to her.   Most of all she&#8217;s personable and professional, communicates well and really enjoys the wrestling. Unless you are a bigger and stronger guy with proficient wrestling skills you probably wouldn&#8217;t stand a chance either.</span><br />
