					<description><![CDATA[Submitting a long overdue review of this awesome lady.  First met in fall of 2021 in Pittsburgh and then in summer of 2022 in No Va. Initial contact and set-up was very easy.  I prefer the hard semi comp to comp style sessions.   Always a little leery of glowing reviews being a little overstated.  We had a little fun prematch banter before our first meeting and this carried over to a fun time on the mats.  While she is a lot of fun, she turns up the intensity, when and as needed, which is important for a semi to comp style match.  She also has a competitive spirit and can handle herself quite well on the mats.  Don‚Äôt be fooled by her model looks and body.  It is full of power, especially her long legs.  If u relax and underestimate her, or don‚Äôt have a good wrestling background, she is going to be all over u with offense and u r going to be struggling.  She has a ton of stamina and endurance too.  Just an overall bundle of fun and competitiveness, mixed in with the right amount of a sadistic streak when needed.  I am sure she is fun for any style session she offers too.  If Jolene gets to your area make sure to look her up for a great overall session experience.  U won‚Äôt regret it.  She can give it to u easy or hard.  lol.  I look forward to having a session 3 whenever she gets back to an areas near me.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I recently sessioned with Jolene in London when she was visiting the UK. I have to say my whole experience was second to none, from the moment I reached out to the moment I walked out the door. Jolene was responsive throughout on emails, and catered for my every need/desire during the session. To say Jolene is in tip top shape would be an understatement, and I definitely didn‚Äôt prepare myself for the beat down that ensued!! Safe to say I was sore for a few days after and tapped out many times whilst she squeezed me stupid (her words not mine <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f60a.png" alt="üòä" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />).
I would recommend 5* and give my bully victim beatdown session a 10/10 experience.
I hope to see Jolene again at some point down the line in the future.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I just got back from Vegas after heading there specifically for a session with this reputation beast of a session wrestler... and it took me almost a full 20 seconds to ease myself into my chair to write this!   

Jolene and I met in the lobby at Excalibur and she immediately feels like you&#039;ve known her for a good while!  She&#039;s so comfortable with this stuff that it&#039;s infections, and you will be too.  I&#039;m pretty new to the scene myself and wanted to see if I was able to handle what she could dish out.  Let&#039;s just get something straight, THAT DOESN&#039;T HAPPEN.  I was able to take a bit of punishment (and you will, ffs), but 40% of her focused but rather casual effort is enough to knock you out if you don&#039;t tap, and she can just lock you up and wait.  She&#039;ll sit on your throat and chat about anything at all while you respond sounding like Donald Duck, she can flip from nice to making you regret it if you try to tough it out for too long, and holy cow she&#039;s solid!  The pictures here don&#039;t do her justice; if you look at them and think she looks too girly to be that tough, well you&#039;re just wrong.  Great voice, great smile, gorgeous everything and hella strong scissors.  She also knows what she&#039;s doing and will give you what you ask for while knowing exactly how to respond if you stop responding - but she&#039;ll go beyond your boundaries if you set them too high for yourself!

Btw, if she asks you if you&#039;ve ever experienced a &quot;butt bomb&quot; then be sure to say &quot;Drew said to ask for the &#039;mean&#039; version&quot; - you&#039;ll be left with a reminder for at least the next week of what you asked for!  And then maybe you too will have to ease your way into your chair when you write her a review - your ribs will love you for it, It feels niiiiice!  <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f351.png" alt="üçë" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f4a3.png" alt="üí£" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f4a5.png" alt="üí•" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />   12 out of 10.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I first met Jolene in person at an event over two years ago, my first impression was this woman is crazy gorgeous, crazy sexy, and well crazy....ha.  I saw her at the Women on Fire event to tool place this past June and knew I&#039;d have to try to see her for a mini-session and almost didn&#039;t.  We weren&#039;t able to connect until 1:40am and barely got out session in.  (They tried to kick us out a couple of times, she just grinned and kept going.) Jolene is stunningly gorgeous, her physique is out of this world and she&#039;s is an amazingly skilled wrestler.  She had full control over me every second we were together and I&#039;m damn near 3 times her size.  I&#039;m looking forward to seeing her for a full session in the future, but at this point I couldn&#039;t have imagined a better night cap to the event.  She has a smile that could brighten the darkest of rooms, she is sweet and kind when appropriate and vicious when needed...or simply when she wants.  Looking forward to seeing her in the future.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I met Jolene at the beginning of this month  at the Cosmo in Vegas. The mailcontact went very smooth. She is very clear and punctual.

I opened the door, was a little bit nervous. WOW !!!! It was very weird for me to see Jolene in real life. She is definitely an angel. From the in and outside. Her scissors are deathly. I tapped almost instantly to all her scissors applied to me. Although I felt a weakling Jolene comforted me. She was so nice to me. During the session we talked a little about everything. She legpressed me into the air ( up and down). I was very impressed. I weigh around 80 kilos and she  did it with ease. She smiled at me...what a smile !! 

The next day I had a big smile on my face. Just the same smile I have when writing this down almost a month later...

Jolene....I hope we will meet again. You made my trip to Vegas spectacular !

Big hugs
From Holland]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[As part of my Vegas tour, I was enchanted by the ever beautiful Jolene.  It bears repeating that she is so incredibly gorgeous that pictures and video cannot adequately reflect.  Even better is the menacing gaze she wears the moment before inflicting punishment.  She is a true an utter sadist, likely on the highest scale I have ever experience in my 30+ years of sessions.  Beyond that stunning face is an exquisite shape wrapped around her iron muscle.  

This was one of the most incredible 2 hours of play I have every experienced.  She was so vicious, so cruel that I was not able to handle her full fury - only snippets at a time.  I felt like I was disappointing her a bit, as I was tapping incessantly.  Her sadist tongue is pure delight and for which I was driven to the heights of subspace.  

I was twisted up in knots, squeezed and crushed with hardly any air to breathe.  I so thoroughly enjoyed the session and can concur with previous reviewers as to just how spectacular she is.  My tour would not have been complete without the fabulous Jolene.  She is a must see if you are visiting Vegas and I will be back when possible.  Thanks Jolene for exceeding all of my expectations.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Jolene is an angel, but I don&#039;t just mean it in the sense of her statuesque physique, sweet smile, beguiling voice, enchanting face, and absolutely heavenly disposition. No.  When I say &quot;angel,&quot; it&#039;s less the gentle winged lady floating on a cloud sounding a clarion call on a trumpet, and more like, um, I don&#039;t know: GOD&#039;S ENFORCER. I mean, this lady is strong, fast, determined, knows how to roll, and will absolutely dominate on the mat with every sexy drip of her verbal assault ringing in your ears and holding you in place just as well as her ironclad armbar, which I absolutely tapped to. But don&#039;t worry: safe control is Jolene&#039;s stock and trade, and if you trust her, then you will be in for an awesome rollercoaster of a session that starts with clear communication, lasts through extended courtesies, and progresses through every step of the way bringing your wrestling fetish to life. From the first slap to the last tap, she gave me everything I asked for.  So see her when you can. My only regret is I waited so long - don&#039;t make that mistake. And why would you? After all, Jolene&#039;s an angel. ;)]]></description>
