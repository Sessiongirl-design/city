					<description><![CDATA[I have not only had Lady O on my show many times, but I also had the utmost pleasure of meeting her for the very first time when I was in New York City.

We did a fantasy boxing match, and she kicked my hind quarters the entire time.  Even got a kick or two on me.

It was so much fun, and such an honor to finally meet her.  I will be back soon for a rematch.  But if you get the chance, definitely take her on.  You will not regret it.]]></description>
