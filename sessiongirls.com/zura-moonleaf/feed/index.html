					<description><![CDATA[I just had a session with the lovely Zura and let me just say that she was great overall. A lovely girl, from the initial emails we sent each other to schedule all the way to when we were doing our session. I asked for her to wrap me up in cling film from neck to toe and she did so very joyfully and my plastic bondage was very tight, to were I felt that there would be no escape for me. Then, you could say the session really began. This would be the part where I would get smothered by Zura in different facesitting positions. Though she was taking it easy on me, she was making sure that I was not breathing at any point and if caught trying to sneak in some air, it would not be good for me as she would prolong the amount of time she spent on a certain position without getting up. She sat on me in the forward, reverse and side positions and I even showed her a new position where she would begin to sit in the forward position but would extend her legs and lay down along my torso and legs, even putting some pillows under my legs, and basically use me as a recliner. If I had to pick, this recliner position was probably my favorite overall. If you are in the same area as Ms. Zura, do yourself a favor and be sure to schedule a session with her. I promise she is more than worth it. The 90 minutes I spent with her was pure bliss. Till next time <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f60a.png" alt="üòä" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Zura is an absolutely lovely lady. I was lucky enough to meet her on her recent trip to London &#038; I&#039;m extremely pleased I did. She&#039;s incredibly beautiful, very smart &#038; really funny. Before her trip we had arranged a session for her time here. Communication was so easy, organisation was absolutely spot on. When we met she was wonderful, laid back, beautiful smile, completely put me at ease. And to be fair her personality completely won me over. We talked for a while, she obviously knew what I had requested, but she looks deeper, gauges what you&#039;d really want to experience. Once we started the session Zura was amazing. She is slender,petite even, but don&#039;t be deceived! She&#039;s very strong, incredibly flexible, very, very quick. She has martial arts experience, jujitsu &#038; wrestling skills. And endurance! TBH I was completely overwhelmed from the beginning. She pinned, exhausted &#038; submitted me effortlessly. She&#039;s so inventive, when she wrestles you it&#039;s like a dance where she is trying new moves! Beautifully graceful. And she&#039;s very attentive to make sure you are ok. She devastated me in the most beautiful way. I honestly can&#039;t say enough good things about Zura, if you get the opportunity do not hesitate to book a session with her, you will not be disappointed! Can&#039;t wait for next time my beautiful Space6irl. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/2665.png" alt="‚ô•" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I met with the beautiful Zura in London this evening. Communication prior to our session was excellent. Zura is petite compared to me (I&#039;m 6&quot;2) but so strong and she wasted no time pinning me, again and again. Despite it being a fantasy session, I did try and escape her clutches, but she was just too strong for me. She&#039;s a bundle of fun and I thoroughly enjoyed our time together. Zura is such a lovely girl. Don&#039;t pass up the opportunity to meet her if you get the chance.

Thank you, Zura. It was lovely meeting you. Hope to see you again <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f600.png" alt="üòÄ" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[What do I have to say about Zura? Zura is one of a kind, truly. I only tour with women who are professional, driven and down to Earth. Her humor is the cherry on top. She&#039;s flexible as hell (she does yoga religiously)....she has the stamina of a horse...and she is a tough cookie. Don&#039;t let the 100 lbs fool you. She&#039;ll sadistically smile and laugh while squeezing the life out of you. 10/10]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I had a great session with Zura a few days ago. Setup and communication was easy. I reached out to her at short notice and she was able to accommodate me with an early session before leaving my area. 

She‚Äôs a legit model, and as you can see from her pics, very beautiful. I‚Äôm always a bit nervous when meeting girls for the first time, but with her, I felt like I made a new best friend. We had a lot in common and had many similar interests. She‚Äôs so cool and sweet, but totally willing to put you in a hurt locker, with a smile on her face. 

She has perfectly sculpted feet, with beautiful soles. She put me in a variety of scissors and chokes. 

I was already planning out next meeting during this one, so I highly recommend you book with her.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Just came back from a 90 minute semi competitive session with Zura, and I had a blast!  I can highly recommend getting in touch with her when she&#039;s visiting your area. 

Setting up the session was as easy and straight forward as it gets.  Despite being a relative newcomer to the session scene, Zura is a pro when it comes to communication and responded to my initial email quickly.  If you read the info and instructions in her bio, and supply her with a concise request of what you want in a session (within her stated boundaries), you shouldn&#039;t have any trouble getting booked.

When it came to the session itself, she proved way more of a challenge than I expected.  Her arms and legs are STRONG and she had the technique for her holds down.  Due to our size difference and being restricted to the hotel bed, I only used my full effort to try to escape from her holds but that still was not an easy challenge.  She&#039;s only just begun taking jiu jitsu courses, and already has a killer RNC.  Her reverse head scissor is deadly too.  I could tell if she just went 100% full pressure I&#039;d be tapping quickly, but she slowly increased the pressure to toy with me for a bit longer.  Zura isn&#039;t just a fetish model posing in some holds for photos.  She can make you tap.

For the last 5 minutes of the session I told her to just come at me to try to get as many submissions as she could without stopping.  I lost count while trying to fend off her continual assault, but I think it was more than 5.  This is where I felt Zura&#039;s dominant side really shined and it was a ton of fun.  I should have suggested that one earlier so I could have been put through the wringer a few more times <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f605.png" alt="üòÖ" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />  I&#039;ll remember that for our next meeting for sure.

I&#039;ll end with saying that Zura is a fun and personable session partner to chat with when she&#039;s not busy squeezing you.  I enjoyed learning about her time in the scene and some of the other work she is doing.  If like your session girls to be kind hearted but strong enough to make you beg for mercy, look no further than Zura.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[So I had a pro wrestling match, mixed with oil wrestling with Zora a couple of days ago, and to be honest, her size makes me underestimate her I thought she‚Äôd be easy to take down but when you bring out the competitive side in her she‚Äôs more than I thought I could handle Zora is very nice cooperative and willing to adjust to your Vikings. Payment process was easy as well as emailing her she‚Äôs fun, creative and has a wicked smile as well as the trash talking, even though being new in the session, she is great at what she does, and is really talented. If you‚Äôre looking for a fun, competitive girl or size will fool you, I recommend booking a session with her.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Zura is very petite, so I was skeptical of her ability to keep me in holds. 
She proved me wrong! I was tapping out over and over from different scissors and chokeholds she put me into. I had a great time and our session was exactly what I was hoping for.
 Besides being able to get into a vicious but fun character, she is a sweet woman in general.  Would love to session again soon!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I recently had a fantasy/semi competitive wrestling session with Zura and she is amazing.  Don‚Äôt let her more petite size fool you, she is really strong and pretty much never let me out of a hold once she got me there unless I tapped. I also requested more of a beatdown where she mixed in some slapping, choking, hair pulling, and belly punches, and she was really good with that too. She seems to genuinely enjoy being in control and inflicting pain, even though she is really sweet and nice to talk to, which was really hot.

Don‚Äôt let her more petite size fool you, she is really strong and pretty much never let me out of a hold once she got me there unless I tapped. I also requested more of a beatdown where she mixed in some slapping, choking, hair pulling, and belly punches, and she was really good with that too.
