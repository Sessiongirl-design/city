					<description><![CDATA[So I met Jackie in Frankfurt, for a little fun fighting (a mix of semi competitive and fantasy). It is hard to put this experience in words and I think this is always a very good sign.

It was the easiest thing ever to set up this session, since Jackie was very responsive. I had no hestitations at all to send the deposit her way. Somehow the exchange of text helps me to estimate if someone has &quot;the sort of fire&quot; that I need to book a session. With Jackie everything was easy and it seemed that my initial mail got her attention, and helped her to trust me too. ( I can imagine how hard this must be)

Meeting Jackie has been an absolute pleasure! Poor Jackie had booked a hotel close to central station and it was easy to find. 

The moment we met for the first time, I new I made the right decision to book her.  She smiled, was talkative and I felt safe too! I think Jackie is a wonderful human being!
The session itself has been sweaty, hard, with lots of scissors, facesittings, holds. The most important thing: We kept laughing, while cracking jokes and pushing each other. 
I think Jackie is very, very strong and will submit you within seconds. But this is enormous fun with her. 

It is this still hard to face the fact that it is Monday today and the session is over! :D I would book Jackie anytime again. I just love what she is doing, her personality, her humor, the fact that I could trust her 100%.

Please keep her safe at all times! Guys this is still a fantasy and no need to really injure someone!

Thank you so much, Jackie!]]></description>

My impression was different. She cannot overcome an average man with some skills. She is too light to handle skilled men over 60-70 kg. Might be a good option for unskilled people and around 60kg and below.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is a long overdue review of my time spent with Jackie. And what can I say that hasn&#039;t already been said? Jackie is truly and utterly awesome. A stunning lady with amazing skill and strength, all I can say is i was simply overwhelmed. 

Communication was easy - we organised a quick trip (her visiting me) which was handled easily and efficiently. 

The session time itself was incredible. Jackie showed off her speed and strength, a lot of which I can honestly say I couldn&#039;t handle! Great use of moves; scissors, sleepers, triangles. Always applied safely and respecting the tap. Just an all round amazing experience. Fantastic conversationalist between my MANY pauses!

My only regret, not spending more time in her company!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Not just a great fighter but also an amazing person....

Contact with Jackie was easy...I absolutely would like to meet her, but with my job and private life, it wasn&#039;t easy...Jackie did the maximum to make it happen...she&#039;s very accommodating...kind and polite...that the first slap on my face...

Then second slap on my face...the meeting...Jackie is statuesque...she has an amazing full toned body, if you like muscular lady, you can&#039;t be disappointed with her, her biceps and shoulders are impressive and are talking for Jackie<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f4aa.png" alt="💪" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />...it makes you intimidated and before any physical contact, you&#039;ll think that challenging her on a competitive way will be...very hard! ...when you face her, you&#039;re confronted to a real athlete that can leave you speechless...she&#039;s really stunning...

Third slap on my face...she&#039;s so kind, easy going, polite could I say even &#039;sweet&#039;...she immediately makes you feel on your own...asking you what you&#039;re waiting from her...

Fourth slap on my face...the fight...I&#039;m about 30 kgs more than her for about the same size... this kind and sweet woman transforms now into a fighting machine, a warrior...she adapted her strength and skills to mine easily...and once on the map, the fight is intense...if by moments, you can hope taking advantage on her, don&#039;t be too confident, she always find a solution to reverse the situation and overcome/overpower you...and make you tap...maybe I had to tap seven-eight times, as she only did it once...and even if she told me she tapped for real, I supposed she let me a little advantage at the end to let me win at least once, if she didn&#039;t cheat, I suppose I was lucky...

Fith slap on my face: after the confrontation, I had the chance to talk a bit with her...Jackie is a very interesting woman, intelligent and can with intelligence talk about many topics...her kindness, sweetness, simplicity, definitely let you KO!

In conclusion, Jackie is a real deal physically, a real challenge...she has a perfect body for the ones who like muscular women, very vindictive, strong, but she&#039;s also so sweet too, well educated... these contradictions make from her a very special person...in the good sense of the word...that I would plenty of pleasure meet again if I have this chance!<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f64f.png" alt="🙏" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

Thx again Jackie for this fantastic session!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I just had an incredible session with Jackie.   I asked for a beatdown and submission session, which she began with some hard knees and punches, and then took me to the ground.  She did not realize that I wanted a complete beatdown first.   Well, this really excited her.  She then pummeled me with hard knees from both legs (her left knee is really strong) and side punches to the stomach until and dropped to the ground.  She then kneed me from the side position and straddled my head from the reverse side pinning my arms within her legs and whipsawed me with lefts and rights to the body until my stomach muscles could not resist, depleting me of breath, allowing me to submit and then doing it again when i recovered..  she then flipped me on my side with a body scissor, again forcing me to submit because I could not breathe.  she would release her scissors so i could breathe, and then do it again.  She picked me up and again kneed and punched me until i fell over.  She then applied wonderful head scissors.  She  finished with a schoolgirl pin while applying a choke hold with just one hand,  causing me to see lights.    Her body is incredible, very soft skin but rock hard underneath.  I did not notice her biceps from the photo, but if you look closely, they are amazing, and even better in person.   she is charming and incredibly skilled, strong, and enthusiastic to apply her martial arts and wrestling talents.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Just purchased a lift and carry video from Jackie and it was amazing! I was not expecting her to be that strong but she pleasantly surprised me. Will definitely be ordering more custom videos in the future, especially her headscissors which I heard are very brutal. Thank you for the amazing experience and I cannot wait for my next purchase.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I’ve had a fantastic time with Jackie in Paris.

It was her first solo visit so there’s still some polishing required on organization - nothing too serious -, and overall a really great experience with a top skilled lady sporting an impressive physique with deep-cut muscles yet not for show: Jackie has a lot of functional strength too.

I was looking for a fantasy session and Jackie completely delivered, always taking care and making sure she was playing with the right intensity so that we could both walk away from our session without any injury. But you can ask her for semi-competitive or competitive and she’ll be more than happy to accommodate your request.

It was a no-rush experience, and I can only advise you to book your session with her, be it in London or if she travels near you.]]></description>
