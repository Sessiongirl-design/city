					<description><![CDATA[Had an incredible session with Julie, who is gorgeous, fun and a whole lotta sneaky strong. Her skills are for real, throughout our session she continually handed me my ass and squeezed me to my breaking point again and again. Despite being larger than Julie it was clear early on I couldn’t hold my own against her and she had no qualms utterly humiliating me, yet I couldn’t be happier! My only regret is that she isn’t based near me as the wait between sessions may be as devastating as her triangle chokes.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Had a very fun session on May 2nd in Milan with Julie! She is a cool and down to earth lady with a vibrant personality. 
I am very happy to have had a session with her, I think it was a wonderful experience.
She may be lil, but she’s strong, fast, skilled, and playful. You can tell that she really enjoys what she does.
I look forward to meeting you again next year.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Me and my family always been on holiday in Padua (Italy) in April-May , My niece Patty is get 18yr old this week and it would be great if she (my niece Patty) could have her first session with a Sessiongirls at this holiday in Italy this year I think Julie could be the right sessiongirl for Patty first Wrestling Session. Stats 
: Patty 18yr-160cm-54kg (starts Judo in 2022 - Yellowbelt now). So I sure will look if we could be book a Wrestling session when Julie will be in Milan Italy in May 2024 for my niece Patty.]]></description>
