					<description><![CDATA[Honestly did not know what to expect. Was even thinking maybe would be to easy to beat her since i did not see any men take her on i doubted shortstop. I have to admit she got the best of me in our match. I had an edge with the strength but that did not last long i was drained pretty quick of my fight and energy. I love her style it was the grappling/ wrestling style not joint locks or bjj moves ma style...... Shortstop is so friendly but all business when wrestling starts and was one of my first times really experiencing domination and trash talk besides one match with bianca.... which really took my head out of wrestling i was really enjoying losing to her and hearing her talk trash and feeling  dominating and was not painful which was nice and just right amount for me....  I honestly usually do very well in my matches besides the elites like Sheena, Veve, and the like. Recently my cardio was my biggest enemy and def was today but she is very hard and did have surprising strength.... if she gets top position she is very hard to get off... ..I was throughly beat by shortstop and its not easy for me to admit that but will def be a rematch when she comes back... it was a fun match and humbling since i honestly thought i would not have to put much effort into beating her. Her legs are great love her quads and seems like she is going work on building up her muscles  and strength....which are very sneaky that do come out during her matches. If i do not get my butt in gear i think she might get stronger then me next meeting. I was really taken back be her and totally under estimated her.  This was def the first of a s many matches it takes for me to defeat her.... her husband is one lucky guy ! So fun and exciting.... i did win arm wrestling lol looking forward to rematch.....]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I recently session with Shortstop and trust me there’s no stopping her. She was very thorough in our session making sure we did everything I asked for. She takes time to know exactly what you want and how to preform. A Really good grappler and surprised me with the amount of different scissorholds and chokes she can put you in. Her thighs are super strong and will either have you tapping or napping. One of the best sessions I have ever had and hopefully I get to book with her again soon. You don’t want to miss out on a chance with her!]]></description>
