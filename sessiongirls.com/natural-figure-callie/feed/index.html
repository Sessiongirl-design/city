					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve met up with Callie about a month ago and I thought I would write a review.
It was my first session, so I was quite stressed, but Callie handled it well. I got to feel up her muscles and armwrestle. I LOVE to armwrestle women, I think there&#039;s nothing sexier than a girl with strong arms, and Callie definitely is strong. We must have armwrestled about 40 or 50 times. Fun times. Considering the price, she&#039;s a very good option for someone&#039;s first session.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I’ve met Callie a few times around the Manchester area over the last year or so.

Firstly, if you’re looking for a competitive wrestling experience, Callie isn’t the girl for you!  She’s a lover, not a fighter and has no aggression in her at all!

She is however very attractive as per the photos.  I can guarantee she will claim your full attention when she opens the door!  She’s also very strong.  Not strong for a girl, strong full stop!  She sat my 90kg on her shoulders no problem whatsoever!  She says she’s squatting 100kg + for reps and I’ve no reason not to believe this!

Her legs are super strong and you’ll know all about it if you’re in a head scissor!  She’s perhaps a little new to some of the holds but if you can offer a little guidance, you’ll experience her strength.  She really is stronger than she looks!  

We’ve also done muscle worship, leg wrestling, armwrestling, schoolgirls pins and face sitting.  Despite being at least 20kg heavier, I can’t beat her in an arm-wrestle!  Zero chance in leg wrestling too and when she’s bouncing up and down on your chest, she can easily knock the wind out or you!    

Above and beyond, she’s very accommodating and willing to please so don’t be shy if you have a random niche/fantasy you want to explore!  I’m sure role play could be on the cards.  She’s probably heard it all before!

Away from the actual session, shes easy to talk if perhaps a little reserved initially.  She’s very well travelled and entrepreneurial!  If you’re planning a trip, there’s a good chance she’s been there or planning to go there soon!

Overall recommended and I’m sure we will meet again at some point all being well.]]></description>
