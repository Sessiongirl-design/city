					<description><![CDATA[Thought i add from my last review that i have had three 2 on 1 sessions with Gabi a while back and in the last match of the session i brought a second friend and took Gabi on 3 on 1 and she crushed all three of us easily..&#039;

I will admit when I am on a wrestling mat I am too afraid to take Gabi on one on one(not afraid of her off the mat, she is very pleasant), she has crushed me all the sessions and i have had 1 to 2 skilled friends to help and still lose by a mile.. Most powerful person (man or woman) I have ever meet.. EVER!!!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I am way past due for this review, a while back I had several wrestling sessions with Gabi, I am 6&#039;4&quot; 310 and used to play offensive line for the University of Northern Colorado so it has been hard for me to find a woman who would go full bore with (I am trying to hurt anyone mind you). So, I decided to ask the biggest woman on sessiongirls and after a couple emails, Gabi told me &quot;No problem&quot;

no problem is exactly what happened from Gabi&#039;s point of view, she is much bigger in person, (she was 630 at the time) and as a lineman who is used to pushing just about anyone around I was completely shocked that I could not move her an inch and a few seconds into a match realized she was playing with me, I told her to go full force and in ten seconds she turned me into a pancake... Never been overpowered like that before in my life... so if you take her on be warned... she can back up her claim to never losing a match. I never took her off her feet let alone win]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[First off, I have 20 years of martial arts and wrestling training combined. I work out regularly, 6&#039;1&quot; 235 lbs., was in the Army and never in my life would I think that a heavy-set woman with no formal training would be the toughest opponent I would face in my lifetime (man or woman), But that is what happened when I took on Gabi.

Despite my skill and athleticism, Gabi was easily (she did not break a sweat) able to beat me every time in a match with her weight and inertia alone, no move or hold I did have any measurable effect on her and once she got head up on me within 5 to 7 seconds, I was buried under her enormous level of fat mass and could not get up until she decided to let me up, even with her giving me some type of handicaps within a minute of the match starting it was over. Mission impossible. She told me that anyone 300 lbs. or less she is not concerned about their skill level because at her 600 lbs. no one that size has a chance, she proved that right...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I saw in Gabi&#039;s profile that she offers 2 on 1 or more in sessions and she is one in the session, so I got a friend from my martial arts class to see if this is the case and turns out she is for real, so we signed up for a two on one competitive pin wrestling session.

We met at a local rec center that have a big enough mat we rented for there for the hour and luckily no one else was in the room. both my friend and I are about 200 lbs. but combined she still outweighed us by about 200 lbs. We did 3 matches of one 1 fall each round, in which she took both of us on at the same time, but she only had to pin one of us. Despite my friend and I best effort Gabi handled us like two little kids and i under a minute each round she won all three falls, I got pinned once and my friend got pinned twice...squash... we could not move her at all, then she just threw one of us to the other side of the mat and proceeded to use her mass to overpower either me or my friend down for a very easy pin

the last three matches were a 2 fall to 1 fall matches, she had to pin both of us to win each match, 2 of the three matches she used the same method as above, but she got up after pinning one of us first and then easily delt with the other. the last match she managed to get both of us in bear hug, powered us down and in the grand finale, she pinned both of us at the same time. My friend and I were wiped out, she was a bit tired as well but nowhere near what we were, anyone could tell who won , the most tiring thing for her was getting up of the mat, AFTER she had pinned one of us...

after a rest she took us on 2 on 1 in tug of war best of three which she easily won...2-0

finally, we did a pushback across a line contest, (wrestling lines on the mat) 2 on 1 as well, best of 3 and she won 2-0 again.

My friend and I had a rematch a while later with same result and We look forward to taking on this enormous human being again]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I had a session with Gabi a while ago, so I am finely now doing a review

I heard she is big, but she is much bigger in person, easily the most massive person (man or woman) I have ever meet, as she states in her profile she has no formal training, but she told me she would not need any to beat me, I am 6&#039; and 225 so not a small guy and I have some martial arts and wrestling training, not an expert but not a slouch either

I found out that going against Gabi is not all the time what she can do to you, but that nothing I did had an effect on her, she gave me a minute to try to beat her and she would only try to stay on her feet. Try as i might I could not budge her let alone score a takedown or pin, then after the minute was up, in under ten seconds i was under her weight on the first offense she did and pinned, and she gave me a long ten count to kick out, it did not happen... Gabi could take on 2 guys like me without breaking a sweat...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have wrestled Gabi 4 times and since all her reviews were on the old site, I thought I would do one here. Some 411 on myself I am 6&#039;2&quot; 275 played football up to college and have done strongman and Scottish Highland games, workout regularly and I thought I would take on the biggest woman on this site.

Gabi responded quickly to my emails, and she accepted to take me on in a competitive wrestling session, she was the first woman to do so. I knew she was big, and I might have some difficulty with her, but wow did I underestimate her by 100 miles, she handled this 275 lbs., in shape guy like a child, within 10 to 15 seconds (or less) of making contact, I was down underneath her titanic weight and squashed. Never thought a woman could handle me like that...she has won every match with ease to date, and she is insanely strong, she managed to get me in a bear hug one match, and I could not escape, I had to tap before she broke some ribs, and she has the most crushing splash ever, completely knocked the wind out of me and I was woozy for several minutes after, and she could subdue me enough to where she had time to hit me with a splash, Sore for several days after.

If you want to find a woman who can overwhelm any man out there, Gabi is your lady]]></description>
