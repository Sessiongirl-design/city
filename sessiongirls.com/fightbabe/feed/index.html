					<description><![CDATA[OK, fellas.  Listen up.
I’ve been doing sessions for over thirty-five years. I’ve probably wrestled over twenty-five different girls. Several of them more than once. I don’t mind admitting that I’m addicted to the “sport” (like I suspect, many of you are).
I have thoroughly enjoyed the time I’ve spent on the mats, with each and every one of them.  In a few cases, I’ve had the pleasure of developing friendships along the way.
In spite of my initial quest for “variety,” I have chosen to confine my session wrestling exclusively to one very special girl for the last ten years.
Based on my experience, one girl stands head and shoulders (at 5’ 6”) above all the rest.
Robin (aka: “ Fightbabe®&#xfe0f; Robin”) is in a league of her own.
Not only is she an experienced and accomplished wrestler and jujitsu practitioner. But she is a creative and knowledgeable woman, who absolutely loves her work.
Get her on the mats, and she becomes a formidable fighter. She’s highly skilled, and strong as a horse – but way better looking.
Her caring, sweet (and often humorous) demeanor – as well as her unique ability to understand your needs, is what makes her truly special. She’s simply very good at what she does.
As some of you may already know, Robin is a true legend – probably more so than any other currently-wrestling girl in the world.
After acquiring years of experience, Robin really knows what she’s doing. Actually, that’s a huge understatement.  She genuinely wants to create and share a meaningful and memorable experience with you.  I promise that you will never forget your time together.  Never.
Robin has developed the ability to totally understand your unique individual needs and preferences. Open yourself up to her. She will get into your head…and make your dreams come true.
Oh…and did I say that this girl knows how to wrestle?
I’m 6 feet tall and 195 pounds.  I played sports in high school and college (but not wrestling), and I’m fairly coordinated. But I am no match for The Fightbabe.
Robin is deceptively strong for her size. She can easily push me around on the mat, and often has me desperately tapping out my submissions. It’s mildly humiliating and moderately embarrassing -- all at the same time. And also, a hell of a lot of fun!
I’ve had the pleasure/privilege to watch Robin (both live and on video) wrestle many girls much bigger than her.  It’s an awesome sight -- as she methodically destroys her larger opponent(s). She seldom wastes any time -- before she skillfully beats them into submission. Occasionally, into a tearful submission. In fact, Robin’s ability to totally dominate… has caused a couple of girls to quit wrestling altogether, and pursue another line of work.
When asked, however – Robin often explains...that she much prefers to wrestle men (as opposed to women).  She says that she enjoys the fact that she “doesn’t have to hold back as much” when wrestling men.
Robin is fearless…and tough as nails.
Robin clearly knows her way around the anatomy (and the psychology) of men. She’s a certified Yoga instructor. So, she not only knows virtually every muscle and bone in the human body, but also every wrestling move in the book (and several that she’s invented, which are not in the book).
Robin will twist you up like a pretzel, before you know what’s hit you. She will use her talents to rough you up, and her feminine charms -- to mesmerize you. She does it all. If she likes you, she might even throw in a free Yoga lesson during the session.
Caution: Try to stay away from those legs. She’s got a heart of gold, but legs of steel. In no time at all, Robin will have you seeing stars…or worse (like “lights out”) with those weapons of “men’s destruction.” She can hurt you badly, if she cares to. So, behave yourself. You’ve been warned.
Robin understands us wrestling guys like no one else…even better than we understand ourselves. She’s smart, well-informed, and knowledgeable about a lot of subjects. Plus, she’s got a great sense of humor.
Put yourself in Robin’s capable hands.  She will not disappoint. Robin is patient, and will do her very best to address your needs, and accommodate your requests. For instance, she loves to “dress-the-part.” She owns an extensive wardrobe of outfits and wrestling accessories. More than enough to please the most particular client.  So don’t be shy.
Whether it’s a competitive match, a fantasy scenario, a BDSM-driven session, or just some good old-fashioned face-sitting. Robin will deliver -- in style.
But don’t delay.  Book your session now.  You owe it to yourself to experience the Legend that is Fightbabe. You won’t regret it.
Any questions?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Just putting this out there I just got my check and already looking to book another session with the Fightbabe I am so addicted to our sessions together because she does what you asked for and when a foot comes flying to your face and pushes you to the ground and keeps you there. You know she is making a victory pose above you. With her foot covering your face nose, mouth,and eyes You only have two choices just lay there and accept it or stick your tongue out and start licking and worshipping her soles because your not going anywhere .... It doesn&#039;t get any better than that!! OMG! If you are like me being a jobber and have to worship your opponents feet after you lose, I promise you have never seen a Robin like this in any video. She is the best and really brings it no messing around. Be specific.in what you want and that is what you are going to get. Don&#039;t miss out if you get the chance, book a session! You would be a fool not to. Responded to every email within 24 hrs or less if she is traveling give her tops 48 hrs. 95% of the time 24 hrs or less. I say this again OMG! I&#039;m memorized! She owns me and knows it but still treats me right!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey fightbabe fans, 
Well I officially had my first session ever and all I&#039;m going to say is the fight babe really paid attention to what I wanted in our session I sent pics of the way I wanted her feet to dominate me .I was like a bride Zilla . I really started to get out of control. If I was her I would have said sorry your too much. But some how she knew It was a first time and I wanted it be perfect. Finally the day of the session I told her to forget everything I asked for It is your show. I figured why am I telling a professional how to there job.

Between the armbars, feet in my face, and the ass smothers I never got to see anything but soles and ass I told her that&#039;s all I want to see I wanted to be dominated. I am so grateful I paid extra for a video because there was a lot I didn&#039;t remember and every time I watch the video I feel like we are having another session.

I will say this with the way she was dominating me with her feet followed by the way she was talking to me and calling me her bitch and telling me your a victim of a 115 lbs girl. It felt so good I was seriously in a trance . I could tell by watching the video . She did everything I requested and more. My biggest problem now is after a perfect session like that, who can I session with now? Nobody is going to be able to top Robin&#039;s performance in that session.
Without going into detail, figure it out for yourself. You will not be disappointed Bravo to the. Fight babe Top notch!

Booked another session in March does that answer your question? Simply the best , no other way of saying it guys and Fight babe, have fun out there everyone stay safe!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I just had the most amazing time with Robin.  It&#039;s been a dream of mine to do a lift and carry session with one of the Legends in the business.  Robin was one of my &quot;crushes&quot; when I first discovered my interests in being lift and carried by girls.  She does not disappoint at all.  She was a little nervous at first, only because she takes this business serious and wanted to make sure she was able to deliver a great session.  I&#039;m a bit over 200lbs, so a little on the heavier side of her comfort range.  However, she was simply amazing. She has some of the best calves in the business. They are the type when you see in heels you turn your head and just say WOW! Robin is easy to set up a session with.  She is also great to talk to.  By the end of our session, it felt like we were friends for a long time and I got a fantastic hug and a promise she would try to make my Century Club when she comes back.  I will say, the day can&#039;t come quick enough.  Robin leaves you wanting more because she is that awesome to be around.  She is top notch and would recommend her for any session she offers. Robin aims to make your session a fantastic experience and delivers.  I can&#039;t wait to see her again, thank you Robin, you made my dream come true.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I am massaging my body..what just happened?  Fun doesn&#039;t describe an experience with Robin..that is too simple of a definition.  Closer to mesmerizing..tantalizing..and a tad disorienting in a good way.  I had teased to Robin that some of my previous sessions were with people that she knew and she could try to get it out of me.  Hm you all like playing with fire?  She didn’t forget this, a first playful? direct squeeze on my stomach..*gahhhh..pant pant..ok I will tell you..just kidding.  She was not having any of it..suddenly a little tighter..I gave in or else I think she could have killed me right there haha.  Let me just list some random descriptions..stamina, meticulous, calculating..never boring..memorable..never expending more energy than she needs to..now to the side bodyscissor..as her thighs rested on my waist and her hamstrings already bulging out.  She only straightened her legs..oof I was already feeling it and had labored breathing.  I told her what if I tighten my abs?  Really?  Silly me.  She played along, yes flex them let&#039;s see what you got.  I flexed, woohoo as she smiled and replied I can flex too and with that scissor went into second gear and anaconda mode.  Straight into body triangle one of my favs..this was a little different though.  Robin simply said, I will just flex my foot..flex your what I thought? and then the pressure increased 20%We were casually talking..I made her laugh..good/bad idea?  Coils got tighter..*guhhh..my eyes widened as I peered down and witnessed Robin&#039;s calf was bulging and digging into my body.  Furthermore you could see veins in her calves too..that&#039;s right!  Honestly I shouldn&#039;t have been that surprised..tighter..legs flexing now with the mission of erasing any core that was trying to be produced..*geuhhh..Robin asked me what kinda language I was speaking..her left thigh was now closing in on my ribs..ooof okok tap tap.  A quick switch to the other side..Robin is thoughtful like that to spread the pressure.  She said excitedly, we have to try the reverse neck scissors..oh yeah what is this six stage approach that I heard about?  Now the neat thing is Robin has so much control that she can perform the six stages all at 20% power so you can feel the increments..first straightening the legs..then abductors..getting tightt..it&#039;s when the hamstrings kicked in where things were kicked up a notch..getting hard to breathe..then the quads and glutes finally upward dog..taptap.  An interesting demonstration in a rear neck scissor..she didn’t even cross her ankles..only pressed her feet together and I felt not one point but waves of abductors..as mentioned super control.  I hope more ladies would embrace the idea of scissor cuddle..it&#039;s like the softer but still direct side than being crushed senselessly.  She laid back as she pulled me down to her..arms putting me into a nice hug but something else was happening as she said, see just a cuddle as I felt python coils as I was grasped in a front body triangle now, her legs flexing into my body..wow I have never experienced anything like that.  She wasn&#039;t even using her arms to pull the legs tighter..do you want to feel helpless?  At one point she sat behind me indian style and my arms were between her legs, no crazy pressure on my joints but I tried to get out..not happening.  She mentioned all the activities she could do like tickle me or put me in a bear hug or have me read her a book.  Ok funny thing at the end..I never bodyscissored anyone before so I thought what better person than queen of bodyscissors?  And here Robin was coaching me..telling me to squeeze harder..more.. rotate your abductors..force the power through your feet..huh?  So here I was trying my best when finally she said ok I think I feel something.  It was funny as shit.. I also started to pull something near my core..didn’t think that was possible.  I think I will stick to the receiving end for now.  Robin is perfect for beginners who are curious what a scissorhoId feels like or an expert who er wants to die? I will for sure be back and have one major regret..that I didn&#039;t meet her sooner.  I will end with this..at some point while I was in her scissor cuddle and trying to breathe normally..I panted, I dunno why I like this, is there something wrong with me?  To which Robin effortlessly squeezed a little tighter without breaking a sweat and simply replied, well I like doing it so is there something wrong with me? Perfect. Answer.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This review will be long. Hopefully not boring. You can scroll away now. 

Okay, being that you&#039;re still here I go ahead by preference by saying I had extraordinary experience with every lady that has allowed me to share the mats and their personal space. This occasion, however, is special. As I had the unexpected honor of a living legend gracing my small town of Washington DC. This is legend is known as the Fight Babe but known all the world over as Robin. I will now make a bold attempt to illustrate my experience. I&#039;ll attempt not to bore you, but you&#039;ll have to stay a while for the juicy bits. Alright, let&#039;s get to the endorsement... I mean review of the Legend that is Robin!

A moment of transparency, I&#039;ve been a fan of Fightbabe for a while. She brought about certain flair to the female submission scene. Put it this way, I&#039;ve never witnessed a California Sun-Kissed Blonde with actual fighting, wrestling and Martial Art skill until her. I&#039;ve always admired her attractive features coupled with her combat talent. However, knowing she&#039;s located on the West Coast I thought, &quot;there&#039;s no way I&#039;ll be able to meet her.&quot; One day I happened to stumble across one of her other pages and BOOM! I discovered that she was coming to my city: Washington, DC. I knew then that this was it, I had to try to book her! Ms. Robin would proceed to affirm that I made the right decision!

I recognized her veteran experience by her top-tier communication. When I requested her for booking, she responded within 24 Hours. That to me is always a sign of great things to come! We booked within three (3) emails but from the time I first emailed her up until the time of our session she stays in touch with me to ensure everything was perfectly set in place for our time together. Sometimes she would just check in to see how my day was going. The causal check-in is always special to me. That is after we&#039;ve taken care of the business of booking our session of course. I&#039;m a sucker for the little things and minuet detail make the difference for me. Overall, this made our interaction less transactional and more a meeting. This is a huge plus for me and further built upon my experience. She made it great before making it great! LOL!

Now to get to the nitty of the gritty. Our session started with some conversation and setup. LOL! Of course, that was after I was greeted with a great, big warm hug! Her grip strength was already apparent and felt. I knew I was in for a helluva of session! She then seemingly did what a lot of women have done as of late; she did a friendly body scan her prognosis, &quot;oh my, you&#039;re strong!&quot; She then proceeds to exclaims the grim possibility of being caught in a headlock. I think I gave her a reprieve when I informed that I don&#039;t do headlocks. LOL! We talked for a good 20-25 Minutes as I proceeded to set up the puzzle mats I brought with me. After we got through with some preliminaries and laid out some &quot;ground rules&quot; we slapped five, bumped fists and got right down to business. 

I&#039;ve been aware of Ms. Robin&#039;s incredible training lineage and wrestling experience. She&#039;s a legend trained by legends and wrestled legends! If you know the names of: Helen Von Mott, Beatice Goffin, Ziggy, Raquel, etc. then you understand that Ms. Fightbabe is a VERY BIG DEAL! Despite my weight and muscle &quot;advantage&quot; I was not one to underestimate her. And I made sure that I didn&#039;t. Ms. Robin made sure that it would have been a crucial and even dangerous mistake to overlook her mat skill in exchange for admiring her beauty and frame. Our initial scramble already put me on high alert to her technique and craftiness. Brute strength and athleticism weren&#039;t going to do ANYTHING to her. She may have not seen it all but she&#039;s seen ENOUGH! We were engaged in the physical chess game. It was so much FUN to have a struggle where our minds meet, and our bodies were just along for the ride. There was one point that she expressed a tiny iota of frustration because I was so calm that she thought I &quot;acted as though she wasn’t there.&quot; On the contrary, I was ultra aware of her presence and skill and was fully focused on being present in our battle. I knew one mistake and I was cooked! She would prove me right later. After the first 12-13 minutes I was able to snap on a Kimura armlock from my full guard. A rare feet for me. Which is crazy because this session pushed my creativity. It also showed me that I need to be way more creative. I was pushed to see how to improve upon an aspect that I home in on. AMAZING! During our second scramble I saw a daring opportunity to take her back in seemingly dynamic fashion. After that I carefully applied a RNC (Rear Naked Choke). Our third round changed the complexity of our session. This is where Robin decides to pull out all the tricks. Next thing I knew I was caught in combinations of joint locks and limb twists. She was able to manipulate every joint in my body until she was able to lock all my joints in a body lock press with a guillotine choke. No exaggeration, no hyperbole and absolutely no joke she locked ALL my joints. She left enough room to allow me to move my wrist to tap out. I was amazed and if she wanted any assurance that I was &quot;aware&quot; of her presence she can trust now I was made very much aware. LOL!  

With the little time we had left we were fortunate to squeeze in two more rounds. We continued the pace of our scrambles because it was perfect for our physical chess game. I was already fully convinced of the legend of the Fightbabe. She had nothing else to prove to me at this point, we just enjoyed an amazingly fun battle! She was able to even things up with tactics to set up another full arm and body trap that left me with no other choice but to tap out. Our final tussle concluded with me catching a lucky break to end up inside control and securing an Americana. And with that, our time was up. If anyone cared to keep score, the match end with me having a 3-2 advantage. An advantage that I had to fight for every second of our session. But honestly, it didn&#039;t matter to me as we left the mats with a great conversation and a bunch of laughter! She even told me to check in and let her know that I made it home safe. Who does that…? By her bright youthful spirit, prime fitness strength and agility and timeless attractive features you wouldn&#039;t know that she has been pillar of this community for decades. What gives it away is her vast library of tactics and technique. Small piece of advice for those who are to book her competitively. She may have seemingly &quot;dainty&quot; frame and classic California Blonde aesthetics but be assure that her skills, tactical knowledge, fitness endurance, and technical acumen cultivated over a storied career will make her worth than a worthy opponent. In other words, Robin is the prime example of &quot;when pretty can whoop your ass!&quot; I should know because she left a good whooping on me! 

I expected to have a great session with a living legend. My expectations were happily blown to dust! I have had been privileged to have shared the mats, time, conversation and laughs with some extraordinary women. There comes an occasion that must take time to place in their proper context. I hope to have accomplished this task being that it took me three months to write this review! It goes without saying that Ms. Robin the Living Legend receives my HIGHEST recommendation! I&#039;m grateful that she has decided to grace my small town with her presence. I&#039;m very much looking forward to the next time our paths cross again. Until then, may the Legend of the Fightbabe rage on!  Thank you, Ms. Robin! Love and Blessings Always!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I had my third session with Robin two months ago, and I&#039;m hoping that by forgetting to leave a review right after the session that she&#039;ll continue to want to use her sexy cruelty on me.

I really don&#039;t know where to begin with Robin, but I&#039;ll start with her physical gifts: she is so incredibly fit and flexible that my girlfriend spends quite a bit of time being jealous of her, much to the enjoyment of all three of us! The way she moves her body is so sexy and scary because her natural walk is like a tigress on the prowl, and when she pounces and attacks she is lightning quick. Of course, she has the face of a model, and the confidence that goes along with it. But the strength of her legs is what brings me back more than any of her physical abilities, and if you don&#039;t believe me, ask her about her gears and I promise that you will feel like a little rabbit stuck in the grasp of a python. However you want to get your butt kicked (scissors, grapevines, ball-busting, or any of the rare and difficult holds that she uses to brag about her flexibility), she&#039;ll deliver.

My favorite thing about Robin, though, is her personality. First off, she&#039;s incredibly professional by finding out what you want so that she can deliver you the perfect session. Before kicking your ass, she&#039;s very vivacious and engaging, and in no way is she a clock-watcher. Best of all, she has a superhuman ability to talk trash and engage in role-play. You feel like you&#039;re inside your own day dream when you&#039;re with her, as she laughs viciously at your helplessness, calls you names, or expertly plays the role of the perfectly dominant woman you&#039;ve been fantasizing about for as far back as you can remember. 

Robin, I wish I could just spend my life getting beat by you. You&#039;re the best!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Tuesday March 14th 9:30am in LA at Fightbabe&#039;s. Bianca &#038; Fightbabe was my very 1st Double 2 vs 1 Session I ever had &#038; always wanted. It was everything I could imagine &#038; dream of. This was my 1st time seeing Bianca. Wow what can I say? Beautiful The Italian Stallion. Setting this up with her &#038; fightbabe was easy, fun, &#038; smooth. The 2 of them were very accommodating with communication, transportation, &#038; provided the mats to wrestle on. They welcomed me with a warm greeting &#038; then I took a Beating lol. They made me feel right at home, I was never nervous, comfy &#038; safe. Bianca is super sexy and sweet. fiery &#038; furocious. I can&#039;t get enough of her cool cute Accent lol. Bianaca is a Bombshell Knockout. She is Genuine &#038; a pleasure to get to know. Pure Strength &#038; so skilled. Her scissors had me tapping out the fastest. Her Friendly Facesitting had me gasping breathless. The Fightbabe I&#039;ve known for 20 yrs now I lost track of how many sessions. The sultry sexy slammin  Fightbabe is gorgeous. Fightbabe is rough &#038; tough. Killer scissors. Athletic talent. Had me submit so many various holds. The 2 of them had me in a double arm bar that my shoulder was in pain lol. The 2 of them double smothers had me seeing Hollywood Stars. They had their way with me pin after pin, move after move. So fast, so knowledgeable, kicked my ass. I couldn&#039;t help myself defend myself. Every hold I was trapped stuck in. They&#039;re the dream team of domination. Very muscular both gifted best wrestlers in the world. I loved every moment &#038; minute of this 2 vs 1 humiliation. The Verbal abuse talking smack talk joking around. Both cruel, cute and playful while I was pinned &#038; in pain. I already had a hard time with 1 of them so imagine both of them at the same time lol. Double Trouble, sleepers &#038; headlocks, it was good night the lights for me. I&#039;ll never ever forget it. This amazing incredible Duo, Combo. The GOATS of Session Wrestling. I&#039;m a big fan of the 2 of them. It was the grand session of a lifetime. I hope to do it again.]]></description>

Setting this up with her &amp; fightbabe was easy, fun, &amp; smooth. The 2 of them were very accommodating with communication, transportation, &amp; provided the mats to wrestle on.

I can&#8217;t get enough of her cool cute Accent lol. Bianaca is a Bombshell Knockout. She is Genuine &amp; a pleasure to get to know. Pure Strength &amp; so skilled. Her scissors had me tapping out the fastest. Her Friendly Facesitting had me gasping breathless. The Fightbabe I&#8217;ve known for 20 yrs now I lost track of how many sessions. The sultry sexy slammin  Fightbabe is gorgeous. Fightbabe is rough &amp; tough. Killer scissors. Athletic talent. Had me submit so many various holds. The 2 of them had me in a double arm bar that my shoulder was in pain lol. The 2 of them double smothers had me seeing Hollywood Stars. They had their way with me pin after pin, move after move.

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve been very lucky enough &#038; fortunate to Session with Robin for almost 20yrs. I just had a session with her in July &#038; a Sexy Silly Skype with her yesterday. Robin is The GOAT. The whole experience is wonderful incredible &#038; awesome from emailing her to set up Sessions &#038; Custom Videos to the end final product. The Sessions are out of this world. She&#039;s so cute in bikinis, her Smile. Then her Ball Busting is 1 of a kind. She is the Scissor Queen. I love her facesitting &#038; smothers to die for. Robin &#038; I are friends. She treats me so good, I take care of her well. Robin will have her way with you. She meets &#038; matches all my session request. We have a blast &#038; a hell of a time. She is Amazing! We wrestle in NYC &#038; in LA. All I wanna do is Session with Robin all the time. She is a Doll &#038; Adorable. 100% Satisfaction &#038; Positive Vibes Only. She makes me tap out, she ko me out. She is a Dream come True. We always have fun &#038; laugh. Nicest butt in the buis, her ass smothers are better then anyone else. Robin is a good sport. I&#039;m glad I&#039;m a fan &#038; friend of hers. Love all of her work. Kick Ass Robin.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve had two sessions with Robin so far, and both were easily 10/10. It was a breeze to set up the session, and when she opened the door she was already wearing the outfit I requested. My god, is she gorgeous. I don&#039;t think a woman can possibly get more fit than Robin, and as I found out later, they don&#039;t get any more flexible either. Such a sultry, sexy woman; such a gorgeous face. Such a fun, playful demeanor, yet capable of sexy cruelty.

Her scissors were so amazingly tight (ask her about the gears!), and her grapevine was so painful yet sensual. Her ball-busting was the best I have yet to experience. Don&#039;t even get me started on the insane number of moves that she used to twist me like a pretzel. Her flexibility is unmatched, and the amount of strength she packs into her sleek, sexy package is absolutely shocking. 

She easily was able to accommodate my fantasy (talking trash to my girlfriend as she kicked my ass and declaring that she us both now), and she seemed like she was having the time of her life. She takes pride in her work and enjoys her sessions. 

Thank you so much Robin! I wish I lived in SoCal just so I could get defeated and humiliated by you regularly! Guys: if you haven&#039;t sessioned with her yet, make sure you do!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I was supposed to have a 1 on 1 session with Robin/Fightbabe at her place in L.A. but I made the mistake of telling Robin that my session was more important than taking her dogs for a walk/hike.  What I found out was when Robin/Fightbabe gets mad she turns into the Black Wydow Spyder and takes out her revenge on any male that makes Robin “mad”.
The Black Wydow Spyder was dressed all in black, including a black eye mask.  She worked me over pretty well, taking out her stress and anger out on me and ignoring any taps to her submission holds.  When the Black Wydow Spyder had thoroughly broken me down, she did what any Black Wydow Spyder does and kills her man.
We had a fun role play domination session and Robin really got into her character.  I can’t wait until I see her again!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Robin/Fightbabe and Jennifer Thomas review

I was in Los Angeles on business and had always wanted to have a 2 vs 1 role play session against Robin/Fightbabe and Jennifer Thomas.  Fortunately, they were both available on the date I was in town and was able to arrange my “dream session” with the two of them.

As I am “older” and no longer able to do semi competitive sessions anymore, this was more of a fantasy role play session where they were in control the entire time and put me in all different types of submission holds to wear me down and make me submit to them over and over.  At times it was 2 vs 1, and other times they took turns tag teaming to beat me up 1 on 1.    One of the highlights was they had me on my knees and made a sandwich of me with one pressed up behind me and the other pressed up against my front.  The pressure against me from both of them was too much to take – I had never been in a position like that before. 

In the role play scenario, I challenged each of them to try to knock me out with a rear naked choke or leg scissors hold, but not let me know when they were going to apply it.  Jennifer got me first when she was able to get behind me and applied a rear naked choke before I could react and defend myself and I was out in under 5 seconds as last thing I remember I was lightheaded and fell to my left side before going out.   Robin teased me all through the session about knocking me out and waited to the end when I was well worn out and could not defend myself.  She took her sweet old time torturing me with a rear naked choke slowly applying pressure, making the anticipation of going out unbearable.  Not sure how long I was out but when I came too, it felt like I was out for awhile in a deep sleep and had a dream that happened in fast forward that I couldn’t remember what I had dreamt.  It took me awhile to come to and figure out where I was.  When I was fully alert, I had a smiling Robin standing over me enjoying her successful sleeper hold. 

I highly recommend if you can set up a session with one or both of them – DO IT!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Gentlemen,  this lady is incredible.  Not only is she beautiful,  her personality will make you fall in love. She is very skilled in her submissions and she transitions effortlessly from one position to another.
For me, having a beautiful woman making me tap while she, at the same time was such a sweetheart, is unexplainable. 
Please gentlemen,  if your ever lucky enough to book a session with the Fightbabe, treat her like a lady and let her do her magic.  For me, our session was all I could think about for a few days afterwards. Hope to roll with her again soon.  P.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Fightbabe.... Wow, where do I even begin?

Robin was my second ever sessiongirl experience in 2014.  I met her through a post of Jay Fox on facebook where she was putting him through a &quot;session pressure gauge&quot; and after a few months of playful banter back and forth, we finally met up in spring of 2014.  I was a year removed from Nikki Fierce kicking my butt and since then I worked hard on my flexibility and overall health to avoid being as flexible as a 2 x 4!  

When I met Robin in her hotel room, her beautiful presence and lovely smile helped me get over my anxiety instantly! We sessioned for an hour and were able to break the ice rather quickly!  The news was on her hotel tv to drown out the sounds and we were even talking about about what crazy things were going on in current events while she had me in a tight headscissors! I was able to roll around into her different headscissors and she even complimented me on my flexibility!   

Since then, we&#039;ve had numerous sessions, christmas card exchanges, happy birthday texts, and lots of awesome memories!  There&#039;s a reason why Robin is a true pioneer with close to 30 years of being a successful producer and session lady!   I was even able to work with her in a few of her videos a few months ago where she demoed her holds and had me be her demostratee (is that a word? LOL) 

Anytime Robin comes to your neck of the woods, don&#039;t hesitate to book her for a session or shoot!  You will be so happy you did!!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[03/05/2021
I am the lucky one to be posting this review here, Robin’s legs are from a different world, apart from
being super nice and very friendly, I tell you the lady can do everything related to wrestling, headscissors
is one of her specialties and I assure you these legs can do BRUTAL damage to your neck. She leg presses
me as if I am a feather and she overpowered me in competitive wrestling. To sum up, if you like being
scissored and you didn’t session with Robin, you didn’t try headscissors yet. AN ABSOLUTE STRONG
BRUTAL BEAUTY. Definitely coming back on that mat]]></description>
