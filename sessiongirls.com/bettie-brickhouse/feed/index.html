					<description><![CDATA[I have seen Bettie Brickhouse on various videos over the years and when I discovered we were going to be in the same city, I had to have a match with her.  I&#039;m  a big, muscular guy and thought I could easily handle her. I. Was. Wrong.  Bettie owned me.  We had a fantasy pro match and thought I might challenge her &quot;a little&quot; and just let her win.  Nope.  She controlled me throughout the match and made me tap over and over again.  Her legs are lethal, but her personality is a joy to be around.  I had soooo much fun.  Bettie is a happy, engaging and easy person off the mats.  We chatted long after the match and she could not have been more sweet...  I want a rematch Bettie!  Just let me come up for once in while.  LOL!!!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I am writing this review the day after I had the pleasure of doing a session with Bettie, and I can&#039;t say enough good things about her.  Did some semi competive boxing with a side of domination. Anyone who sessions with Bettie will tell you about her strength and power.  I&#039;m not a small guy and she pushed me around in the ring with ease and slugged with controlled fury. I got an intense pounding and the only bruises are to my ego.  Bettie is a pleasure to do business with, and was very accommodating about my attire request and totally game to roleplay my fantasy scenario.  Not only is Bettie athletic, powerful, and wonderfully dominate, but she was amazing in the role I laid out.  She&#039;s more than capable of giving a competitive bout, inhabiting the role I laid out, and just super chill to be around.  Bettie is a real gem of a person, and if she&#039;s in your area on tour, or if you are in her neck of the woods do yourself a favor and book a session with her.  It is money well spent.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;span&gt;I’ve met Bettie a couple times in Chicago over the years and am always surprised by her power and strength when we meet. She is a consummate professional and can be confident or just downright dominant depending on what you ask for. &lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span&gt;What is great about her is her desire to win, yes, her weight advantage made her tough for me to begin with but the way she went about submitting me, combined with some great trash talk, gave me a real sense of being “overwhelmed.” Though she is well established I am aware the reviews on this site have not been carried over so I will announce that I cannot recommend her enough if you’d like to be completely “bowled over” by a larger, dominant lady.&lt;/span&gt;]]></description>
