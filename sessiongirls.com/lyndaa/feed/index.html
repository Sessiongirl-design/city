					<description><![CDATA[Lyndaa is one of the most elite fighters on this website. She brings a lot of intensity when it is time to compete and gave me coaching on how I can improve my skills. She is a down to earth and respectful person, who does it because she is passionate about martial arts and not for the money. I highly recommend her and wish her nothing but the best]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[On May 25th I had the pleasure of getting to session with Lyndaa. She is a very warm and inviting person who immediately made any nerves I had go away, and she was also a very chill, go with the flow type of person (but I can promise you she’s always ready to fight). She is very attractive in person, and although she is short I would not underestimate her power. We spent the first couple hours just talking and getting to know each other, but she was ready to fight as soon as I was, and we definitely did. We wrestled for about 2 1/2 hours total, I came close to getting her in some holds a couple of times but never managed to make her tap. She is a great fighter and it’s clear to see when you’re an opponent facing her. The 2 1/2 hours of wrestling went by super quick, and were definitely some of the best hours I’ve ever spent In my entire life. If you’re looking for a chance to fight against a professional, who’s going not going to go easy on you then Lyndaa, is definitely your girl! My session with her was 100% rough and competitive because that’s what I wanted, but she also offers less competitive sessions. Her pricing is super affordable and you definitely get more than you paid for when sessioning with Lyndaa. Her and I will definitely have another match, and I strongly advise anybody reading this to reach out to her! It’s very easy to set up a match with her and she is very effective and prompt when it comes to communicating!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Here is my second session with Lynda she is always lovely and friendly and we always have a nice chat before begin. I gave away Lynda some pretty leggings (scrunch leggings to flatter the booty) for this session WOW...! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/2665.png" alt="♥" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> I don&#039;t sure if these leggings were made for her or if Lynda&#039;s body was made for these leggings. OMG! Lynda&#039;s got legs and she knows how to use them...! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/2665.png" alt="♥" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> her legs are solid steel...!  Was incredible to know the strong Lynda&#039;s legs are...!, Also her jiujitsu skills are great.
I was thinking in have another session with Lynda, in my first session she showed me her great skill and strength, in this second session she left me as a rag doll, and maybe in the third session Lynda finish breaking me up, but well...! I will be happy to leave Lynda to make this on me...!

					<description><![CDATA[I had a session with Lynda, she&#039;s very lovely and friendly, I had thought of a fantasy role-play as were all my past sessions, and like this we began, but I asked Lynda to show me something of her jiujitsu skills and she did it...WOW! Lynda submitted me with her holds very easily, she was incredible, Lynda is fast and also she&#039;s very strong, I could not do anything to get free of her submission techniques, she also did explain each of them and I was very interested to know about it, so we continued but not with my role-play I had thought, this now was a Semi-Competitive Wrestling and it was my first experience in this session type thanks to Lynda, I&#039;m expecting to have another session with her very soon, of course, &quot;Semi Competitive Wrestling&quot;...!<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/2665.png" alt="♥" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Lynda is fantastic in this sessions kind. 
And if you are one who loves Semi Competitive Wrestling, Lynda will give you a great experience...!]]></description>
