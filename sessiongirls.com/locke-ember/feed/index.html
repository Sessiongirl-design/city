					<description><![CDATA[Had a great fantasy boxing session with Locke today. She is super sweet and has a great personality. She hasn&#039;t been doing this long but she knows how to throw a punch! She hits hard and has fun doing it. I told her what I wanted and she delivered. I cant say enough positive things about her. If you have the chance, take advantage of it. You wont be disappointed. I know i wasn&#039;t! Until next time.........sooner rather than later hopefully!!!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Domina Locke alone is an absolute treat, gorgeous and friendly, but pair her up with Pocahontas like I did during their stay in Indiana and you will have a session they will sing of in legends. These two from the second the door opened were a whirlwind of dominant energy. Within moments I was pinned, smothered, and completely overwhelmed in the best way possible. I will definitely be booking another session with them and I highly advise doing the same. After doing sessions for several years these two are by far my favorite and I can not sing high enough praises for them.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I just finished sessioning with Domina Locke and was truly an amazing experience. Her role play trash talk was excellent, she really got into her role and she made it fun for both of us. Her constant was top notch. What I enjoyed the most was her very playful personality. She truly seemed to enjoy her domination which made it fun for both of us. Very down to earth and great to talk to. I just met her and instantly felt comfortable with her, will definitely session with her in the future.]]></description>
