					<description><![CDATA[I had the pleasure of meeting Ginger Kateryna in person and don&#039;t think it is possible to put my experiences in words well enough . It started with her response to my initial message to her. 
It was clear within seconds that this session will be good and I sent the deposit right away. There was no reason at all to hestitate and this was just due to this first response by Ginger Kateryna. 

Well you can read about what I like in my profile. I&#039;m not booking sessions, because I expect something from session ladies. I hope they feel safe with me, and from that point everything else can develop freely. And I think this worked for both of us.

Thank you so much Ginger Kateryna, can&#039;t wait meeting you again, if you&#039;d like that too! 

Please keep her safe at all times. Don&#039;t forget this is just a fantasy and should never become to serious!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I haven&#039;t written a review for any girl on the platform yet, but for Ginger Kateryna I think it&#039;s worth sharing my unique experience. I had a first session with Ginger in Prague a few months ago and since then several have followed... <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f917.png" alt="🤗" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> I just started my journey into the world of female domination through wrestling to experience new sensual adventures and decided to meet Ginger Kateryna as my first stop with based on what I have seen so far on the social networking platforms where he participates and uploads videos and photos but also on the site where I am now writing my experience. I think the experience with her is unique and unrepeatable. It was like an angel came down and gave me everything I wanted. My wildest expectations were exceeded. Already the conversation beforehand in emails and in the first contact was extremely pleasant. She is a very educated and kind girl with a smart sense of humor. We met at the Hilton Prague Hotel and he immediately gave me a big hug. What can I say….I felt very comfortable as if I knew her from a past life…We had a nice chat before we started and she let me choose her outfit because she has a rich and elegant wardrobe!
First of all Ginger is extremely attractive, a well trained body, with well formed muscles. We started with a few different scissors. I immediately noticed that her thighs were very high and toned which excited me. We did an escape challenge. Other than being able to push her away from me due to my weight, I had no chance of escaping her long and strong arms. She&#039;s strong, she&#039;s fast. She dominated me verbally and physically and that was what made me bow before her !!! She also loved to dominate me and command me to worship her endless legs and gag me in the face with her endless body
Finally I can say that Ginger Kateryna is extremely cute, pleasant and intelligent. You feel comfortable with her as if you have known each other for years. And her sessions are awesome. He doesn&#039;t just respond to your wishes...he wants to know them. This great girl is not to be missed. Highly recommended especially for female supremacy fans like myself <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Ginger? A real deal!

I had the chance to meet Ginger last summer...and I only have positive feelings about her.

I&#039;m a normal guy, not especially weak, not especially strong.

First when you meet her, you&#039;re impressed by her size, she&#039;s tall, lovely long legs that are lethal, athletic/fit body, her beautiful eyes and smile before beginning the session are to let you blush immediately, but she&#039;s cool,easy going and immediately let you feel on your own.

When the session begins (I asked for a competitive grappling/wrestling), she moved from a very charming woman to a combat machine: she&#039;s skilled, strong, competitive, dominant, prepare you to be a prey for her, and if you can try to let her tap, she doesn&#039;t give up easily...maybe in our session I had to tap 7-8 times when she tapped 3 times.

In conclusion meeting Ginger is a real challenge for normal guys or even for skilled ones because of her fighting spirit and skills, she&#039;s very agreeable to fight with, she&#039;s a real deal! Hope I could meet her again...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello everyone  !
I am totally thrilled and even more impressed by Ginger Kat. Some time ago I had my first fantastic session with her. So good, so intense on the mat, she immediately took control and showed me wonderful holds and leg scissors. I love her endlessly long legs, I really wouldn&#039;t have expected her to have that much strength and endurance. A big compliment to Ginger Kat. What a talent, what a session girl. So much power and beauty, plus her very good technique and strength. No doubt you just let yourself be dominated. Plus her laughter and of course she loves to have you firmly in her grip and pin you to the mat. Honestly, I&#039;ve rarely had so much fun at a mix wrestling session. Her size and her charisma simply blow you away, very likeable and yes, she knows exactly what she wants and what she doesn&#039;t want! Conclusion: immediately and again with pleasure, I am waiting impatiently for the next opportunity to roll on the mat with her. Great  !!!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I met Ginger a few months ago in Spain. I had seen her wrestle and noticed that she was very skilled, and luckily I was able to schedule a session with her. And, wow, she did not disappoint! Ginger is really very nice and easy to get along with, but she is dominant during session time, which is just the combination I like! 

Nowadays for me, there&#039;s only one in about four or five wrestlers I meet that I want to session with repeatedly, and Ginger is definitely one of them. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f60a.png" alt="😊" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> I&#039;m hoping to see her again soon. Highly recommended!]]></description>
