					<description><![CDATA[I had the absolute pleasure of experiencing a session with Alex recently. Like Alex, I have been sessioning for over 20 years and I knew it was going to be fantastic considering how instant and deep our connection was from our very first exchange. Scheduling was easy and efficient and when we met her physical beauty and strength was matched only by her wonderful charming, witty and kind personality. But make no mistake she isn‚Äôt afraid to unleash every bit of her strength and skill through a variety of scissors, holds and smothers. She totally had her way with me while devilishly laughing as I struggled and tapped, helpless to escape except for the few times she let go so I could worship her feminine, muscular body. 

Alex is a beautiful person inside and out and I‚Äôm so glad we met. Can‚Äôt wait to share more laughs, stories and squeezes soon! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f618.png" alt="üòò" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/2764.png" alt="‚ù§" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

					<description><![CDATA[Anonymous Review:  

Meeting Alex was like a happy dream.   She is such a warm and gracious person -- smart as they come, responsive, so pretty and strong.    This was my first session of this sort and I was a mixture of anxious and embarrassed when she showed up, as it was all brand new to me.   She put me at ease immediately, asked tender and well-considered questions, and proved a delightful conversationalist.   And THEN! -- this beautiful woman was wearing a black sweater that covered her magnificent muscles and when I reached out to touch her arm I was stunned by how hard it was and how it grew as she flexed.   How coolly she held me in place, with a confidence and sassiness that was exhilarating.   Thank you, dear Alex.    I hope I will see you again -- and I&#039;ll dream of you tonight.     .]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Alex needs no introduction, she has been doing this for over 20 years and while I‚Äôve encountered girls with much less experience and were naturals you cannot replace the experience of a season pro, a true legend. Communication, session was set up by the 3rd email. I got incredible vibes from her email, I knew she was the one to see. She had been on my radar for nearly a decade, I regret it took this long to meet her. She found my hotel with ease, she gives me a big hug, and after an icebreaker it felt like I had known her all these years. I requested semi-competitive wrestling with domination. Her body is rocksolid, wicked scissors. She‚Äôs incredibly playful, laughing, smiling, wonderful at conversation. She had no problem dominating me and teasing me as she gained the upper hand. At the same time she still has that dominant side of her, but was different in a sense, age and experience gives her a strong aura, you know that you‚Äôre in the presence of a strong, seasoned, woman of importance. She has a confidence you can only get from experience that commands respect. I felt like I was wrestling with a top business executive, elite politician, some high-ranking official, a woman of power &#038; authority, only with muscles, knows how to wrestle and beat men into submission. She is also quite involved with the sessioning world advocating for individuals, sharing her over two decades of experience, And happy to give referrals to her clients. When you are done having your hand held in session school, session with a legend that will show you how to graduate!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Alex is so so so amazing and ridiculously beautiful. I sessioned with her a few months back at a hotel in NYC. I&#039;m a tall guy and the bed was a bit small but she really made it work and tried out a whole range of super tight scissors. She&#039;s so kind and playful but when she&#039;s ready to dominate she&#039;ll bring you down easy. She hits the gym all the time and you can immediately tell the second you even touch her.  Amazing first experience and I&#039;m so happy I chose Alex. PS/ sorry it took me so long to post, had to deal with some issues at home! But guys, definitely book a session with her.]]></description>
