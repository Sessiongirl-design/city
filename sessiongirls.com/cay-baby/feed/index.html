					<description><![CDATA[Wow. Easily a 10 out of 10. My recent ninety minute session with Cay in the Detroit suburbs was absolutely amazing. This was a session where I just tried my best to avoid and escape holds. No offense on my part. Her pre-session communication was great and setting everything up was a breeze. When I met Cay on the day of my session, she immediately put me at ease. I always feel nervous to start, but that went away very quickly with her friendly and casual conversation. I provided a few ideas for our session and she was not judgmental about them at all. She agreed to everything, but if she wasn’t into something I get the sense she would just politely decline and not make a big deal of it. You won’t feel stupid or embarrassed asking about something. 

The session itself was one of the best I have ever had. I’ve had many sessions with others before, but there’s something about the way Cay applies holds that makes them devastating with what seems to be little effort on her part. I’m not into knockouts so we stayed away from that, but she definitely had me seeing stars and could have easily knocked me out if she wanted to. She’s relentless too. I usually don’t tire easily during sessions, but she had me worn out before our time was halfway done.

The connection we had during the session was great as well. Cay genuinely loves what she does and loves to see faces turn purple. My natural reaction to being in any type of hold is to clench my face and close my eyes in pain, but I made sure to maintain eye contact with her throughout so she could get the most satisfaction from her work. And that look in her eyes when she has you down is priceless.

As with any session, I was disappointed when our time was up, but I’ll definitely be booking again so I’m thrilled to know that our paths will cross another day, hopefully sooner rather than later. She actually floated an idea to try during our next session, which leads me to believe it will be even better than the first now that we know a little bit about each other’s interests and kinks. And just a closing note, for all the talent Cay has at this age (19), and for still being relatively new to the session world, she has the potential to be one of the greats if she sticks with it. She checks all the boxes for sure. Book a session with her if you can. You won’t regret it.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Had the pleasure of a second tickle session with Cay, this time with restraints and a fun role play scenario. Cay was just as lovely and ticklish as the first session, and the hour I booked flew by! One of the sweetest, coolest models I&#039;ve met, and one of my favorite sessions. If she&#039;s in your area and you&#039;re not booking her, you&#039;re missing out!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I had the pleasure of a session in Maryland 5-3-24. I think she will know who this is. She was a lot of fun to talk to and even more fun to wrestle. I thought I would have to let her win sometimes but I was wrong. She was able to handle me completely. By the time I left, we both knew who the better wrestler was. I will be looking for a rematch when we get a chance. You can&#039;t win every fall, every time. See you on the mat.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I had a very fun lift and carry session with Cay.  She is easy to set up with and honest.  She is very professional and friendly.  She had to cancel on me due to some unforeseen difficulties, but was straight with me and refunded my deposit with no issues. When she planned a return trip to NY, she remembered our previous conversations and was quick to set up with me again.
Let me say, it was worth the wait.  Cay is very sweet and easy to get along with.  I was welcomed with a hug and she was ready to go.  Cay is very strong and I&#039;m proud to say, she is the newest member of my Century Club.  She took to my challenges like a champion and was determined to rise to the occasion.  I&#039;m a little over 200lbs and she was able to pick me up from the floor onto her shoulders.  I can&#039;t wait to see her again to see what else she can do.  I would definitely recommend her for anything she has to offer.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I had a wonderful session with Cay Baby when she visited San Francisco in March! I sessioned after a year and have had 5 to 6 previous sessions. I have to say this was by far the best session I have had!

Cay is so young! Only 20-ish and freakishly strong. I am someone who is heavily turned on by a strong upper body. My sessions usually involve strength tests and fewer scissors. Cay outdid me in every contest, and I am a fit 31-year-old! Her biceps are strong and big. Don&#039;t do by the stats here, don&#039;t think they are updated. She has grown much, much stronger since these pics were taken.

She replied quickly to my requests. The location was also very good. She is so sweet as a person, always friendly and smiling! Gorgeous looks and she smelled great, too :P 

I got beat 6-0 in arm wrestles. And pinned multiple times, I lost count. Even from advantageous positions, she turned the tide and somehow ended up losing, hearing her taunts of losing to a 20-year-old!

I did beat her in leg wrestling once! So there&#039;s that. Guess she will have to revisit me to avenge that!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I was very excited to shoot with Cay Baby after meeting her at FetCon and she did not disappoint. Her legs are very strong and she knows how to use them. If you catch yourself going into her reverse scissor hold, just know that you&#039;re in for it. For me, she was sensual and gave natural degrading and sadistic dialog. From meeting her, when you arrive, you may be tempted to underestimate her due to her friendly demeanor and beautiful smile, but when it comes time, get ready for a fantastic session.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Was fortunate enough to meet up with Cay for a tickle session and... WOW! Cay is just wonderful, and the hour I booked flew by. To start, she is drop dead gorgeous, and among the friendliest, warmest people I&#039;ve ever met, which will immediately put anyone at ease. As for the session itself, Cay was wonderfully (hysterically!) ticklish and responsive, and took it all like a champ!

If she is coming through your area, do not hesitate to book her! One of the best sessions I&#039;ve ever had the privilege of experiencing!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I just sessioned with her in Chicago and I’ve got to say she comes as advertised! First off if you’re someone that gets nervous before a session that won’t last long at all. She’s super talkative and will get you out of that nervous state pretty quickly. Down to the session, we agreed on semi competitive in our emails. Today’s session is definitely the most effort I’ve put in against a session wrestler. For most of the session I was putting up decent resistance to her taking me down but wasn’t going 100%. Once she had me in a pin or submission I essentially gave 100% resistance trying to get her off of me. I managed to escape a few times throughout the session but basically once she had me down I was stuck there. She had me up in a school girl pin for at least 5 minutes and I was trying to get her off of me the entire time but was trapped. She’s just sitting there on top of me laughing and says “I love that you’re actually trying.” I’m about 190 pounds so I was bigger and stronger than her but her cardio is insane. Towards the end of the session there really wasn’t much of a strength gap. Once we hit that 40 minute mark she seemed like she was still at full strength and I was spent. She’d get me in a pin and I’d sit there for like a minute or two before I’d even attempt escaping just trying to catch my breath. Once I tried escaping I couldn’t even get her to budge. Her scissors are no joke either. I got absolutely dominated by this girl and I can’t say I wasn’t trying because I definitely was. Mini Beast is the perfect nickname for her! If our schedules lineup again in the future there’s no way I wouldn’t repeat with her, awesome session!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have just finished a scissor session with Cay in Utah. What more can i say about Cay? She is cute, kind, and her legs are absolute skull crushers. I couldn&#039;t believe how powerful she was until i actually felt it. She does not go 100% strength for safety reasons but I was doing the thousand yard stare a couple of times with 80% of her strength. The scary thing is she is not in her athletic prime yet and she can only can get better and stronger as she continues to grow. Although she is only 19 years of age, she has a very good head on her shoulders and great understanding of the business. She was very punctual with communication prior to the session date. She obliged to all my requests to prepare for the session. She even went to the gym to do leg workouts that day and definitely warned me that her legs will be ready to put the squeezing on me. Her work ethic is second to none. I could see her becoming one of the best in the business in a couple of years. My only regret i had was i didn&#039;t book another hour with her. Highly recommend and will definitely book her again 11/10.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[FUN FUN FUN.  Wrestling around with Cay was a blast.  Time flew by and we were evenly matched because I have 100 lb&#039;s on Cay.  She more than held her own and won the session 12-7.  I will definitely session with her on the next visit.  Thanks for a great time Cay. Hope to see you soon.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I recently had the privilege of working with Cay during her tour in Richmond, and let me just say, she is the living, breathing definition of “small things that come in big packages”. If you’ve done your research and read the reviews, then you already know that this girl has strength. We competed in a semi-competitive match, and while I was able to hold my own against her at times, she’d end up finding a way to fight back and squeeze a submission out of me. Her legs are her most lethal weapon. Upon looking at her, you wouldn’t think so, but once they’re around your head or your waist, it’s only then that you realize your only form of escape is through submitting. Needless to say, but at the conclusion of the match, I was completely worn out

Doubting this firecracker just because she’s young and small is a decision that will only end in shock and defeat for you. Cay is not only resilient, quick, powerful, and crafty, but she is also intelligent, well-spoken, and self-focused. For someone so young and hot off the heels of her rookie year in the session wrestling world, those are absolutely remarkable qualities to have. If she’s this good now, you have to wonder what she’ll be like in the next 3 or 4 years. She’s constantly training and putting in the work to make herself better, so it may not even take that long. If you have the opportunity to work with Cay when she’s nearby, please treat her right, guys!]]></description>

<p>Doubting this firecracker just because she’s young and small is a decision that will only end in shock and defeat for you. Cay is not only resilient, quick, powerful, and crafty, but she is also intelligent, well-spoken, and self-focused. For someone so young and hot off the heels of her rookie year in the session wrestling world, those are absolutely remarkable qualities to have. If she’s this good now, you have to wonder what she’ll be like in the next 3 or 4 years. She’s constantly training and putting in the work to make herself better, so it may not even take that long. If you have the opportunity to work with Cay when she’s nearby, please treat her right, guys!</p>

					<description><![CDATA[I saw Cay last night when she was in Philadelphia and it was an amazing time. She is very easy to set up with and is super responsive. In person she is a pleasure to talk with and has a positive bubbly personality that makes you feel completely relaxed. We did a worship session and it was everything I could ask for in a session. If she is coming to your area, I would not hesitate to reach out. I will definitely be seeing her again next time she comes through.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[She&#039;s fairly new at the game and has to be about the youngest girl on the site at19 but her learning curve is unreal and she&#039;s turning into an absolute beast. She tells me she&#039;s already dominating much larger men and based on my experience with her I wouldn&#039;t doubt it.  

We  first wrestled about six weeks ago and were close to even although she probably had a slight edge. I was fairly impressed given that I&#039;ve ben doing mixed wrestling for. 15 years and had good 40 pounds on her.

But she was clearly unhappy with the result. &quot;I&#039;m coming back in a month,&quot;she said. &quot;And I&#039;ll beat you 5-0.&quot;

The rematch was today and it didn&#039;t last long.  Cay had added about 10 pounds of muscle and learned a bunch of new moves. She had me 7-0 before I knew it and each time she had me pinned or twisted into a pretzel within seconds. 

I had gotten a couple of submissions on headlocks in the  first match, but by now her arms and hands  had gotten so powerful that she simply pried the hold loose. 

Hard to imagine what she&#039;ll be like when she matures to full strength.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Just saw Cay in Philly, after about 10+ sessions with other girls. It was a blast, top 3 session ever! 

 Cay is certainly new, but is learning fast.  Deadly headscissors, surprisingly strong, cute, and a adorable facesit. I highly recommend booking her ASAP when she&#039;s in your town, otherwise you might miss her!

Set up was easy, fair rates, and she overall communicates extremely well, especially with the interests in getting better with each passing session. Will ABSOLUTELY book again when she is in town.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Just had a fantastic double session with Chloe Cummings and Cay Baby.

Chloe&#039;s experience contrasted wonderfully with Cay&#039;s cuteness, just as the former&#039;s pantyhose and thong contrasted perfectly with Cay&#039;s pink bikini. 

Chloe went all out in going full competitive against me, and we were very evenly matched. She was aggressive but sensual, strong, but fast. Her smack-talking is genuine and goes a long way in wearing down her opponent psychologically.

Cay showed incredible drive, and uses her excellent and ever-improving defensive skills to wear out her opponents. Her flexibility and great cardio serve her well. Her incredibly sweet demeanor pairs so well with her great fantasy acting skills.  

Both gals were dripping with charisma and open-mindedness, as well as a genuine love for the craft.

You gals are the best &#060;3]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Had a session earlier today with Cay in NJ.  Friendly and upbeat communication via email, just as friendly and upbeat in person.  Cay opened the door and looked just like she does in her photo with the yellow bikini, which is awesome : )  Some conversation before we started helped ease the nerves, and during the session Cay really strived to take on the role we discussed in our emails.  She checked all the boxes: intensity, authenticity, and sensuality.  I left wishing I would have booked a 90 or 120 minute session instead of 60.  Next time!  Thank you so much Cay!]]></description>
