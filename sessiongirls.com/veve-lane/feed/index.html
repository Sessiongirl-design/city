					<description><![CDATA[This was my first session ever and I was very nervous about it, but all that anxiety went away when I met Veve Lane.  She was very friendly and made everything feel normal.  We did a semi-competitive wrestling session with spanking and facesitting.  Even in a semi-competitive match, it is easy to tell how strong and talented she is as a wrestler.  In our roleplay scenario, she was perfect as my favorite teacher.  It was just like being in one of her Doom Maidens videos!  In person, she looked incredibly beautiful and has a fantastic muscular body.  Setting up a session was very easy and she responds to e-mails quickly.  I highly recommend sessioning with her especially if this is your first time.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello everyone  !
I just experienced my highlight of 2024, the super nice, intensive mix wrestling session with Veve Lane from New York as a guest in Düsseldorf Germany. A true legend in session wrestling. It&#039;s really unbelievable how well trained Veve is, her biceps are wow and her leg scissors are awesome. A great feeling again and again. I&#039;m learning, I&#039;m amazed at how dominant she is. We had so much fun with everything from semi-competitive to fantasy wrestling to a tickle session. She can do everything, always has a smile, which I didn&#039;t always have. But it was also my wish. Perfectly implemented. A profile, Veve is great. The time went by far too quickly, this session will be remembered for a long time. If you have the opportunity to book it, you should definitely do so.
Conclusion: Particularly good]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I had an amazing session with Veve today and it was one of the best. She has a very warm personality and is stronger than she looks. I weigh close to 260 lb and she had no problem rolling around with me on the mat and putting me in submission holds. I went 5 rounds with her and she won every time. It was a full body workout. Veve is not just a session girl, she is a legit wrestler. If you are a competitive person, you should definitely meet her.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[She gave me exactly what I wanted, a competitive, sweaty, submission style match without any judgment or distaste for the idea. She had a very pleasent demeanor when I first met her, and it&#039;s clear she has a heart of gold. I could tell she enjoys what she does since she will laugh under her breath when she inevitably traps you. I also admire the punishment she could take. She may be small but she is made of iron. I truly hope I get to meet her again.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Well.... It has been a few years but I had the chance to meet Veve when she was in Florida. I requested a MMA style match. Right out of the box I was over powered by strength and skill. I lasted about 30 seconds and she finished me without effort. I will definitely rebook when she returns to South Florida. Scale of 1 - 10..... 10+]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Will I ever get a submission out of VeVe after trying for almost 10 years?  I have dramatically improved my cardio/stamina over the last couple of years where I can pretty much keep up with her for almost 2 rounds. I have substantially increased my muscles to where I should be stronger than VeVe.  I have even taken virtual BJJ classes to understand how to apply and get out of holds. So physically and mentally, I am in great shape and yet she continues to submit me a humiliating number of times and escapes any of my attempts to submit her even with my substantial height/weight advantage.

My recent competitive match with her (that she recently video released on Doom Maidens) added bare fisted gut punching, and hand slapping of face/ass.  I figured I would have a strong advantage on hits due to my much longer reach. I quickly learned that her BJJ holds enabled a dominating number of punches and slaps to me and kept me from getting any punches/slaps with any significant force to her. And her slaps to the face and ass (and fist punches to abs) were very painful like her extremely tight bondage rope ties!  If those slaps to to my face had been with a closed fist, my face would have been a bloody mess. My ass still had bruises and welts for a week and my abs area was red and painful for days. I had always wondered how I would do in a street fight with VeVe if I could throw punches at her with my longer arms and now I know that terrifying answer.  

The BJJ part of the match was more challenging than ever for me because I couldn’t multi task very well between trying to hit her, preventing her from hitting me, and at the same time trying to avoid any BJJ holds, all in hot temperatures where we were profusely sweating and it was difficult to make a solid hold. VeVe was brilliant in that environment and with the multitasking, and with her speed and agility, I did not stand a chance.  It was my most painful 2 rounds ever and then she added an excruciatingly painful punishment round at the end where I was not allowed to defend myself, with her using more powerful and frequent hits.  I was on the verge of crying and begging.at times.  Then she humiliates me further by painfully foot slapping my face and then making me gag on her foot.

So in my long term quest to get at least one submission from VeVe, I am seriously considering the only thing left to improve, getting some BJJ training/practice and earning some belts.  I’m still coming after you for that first submission VeVe!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello everyone  , ... !
A real experience, definitely one of the best sessions I&#039;ve ever had. Why ? Simply because Veve Lane is incredibly good, my idol for many years. I&#039;ve been a fan of hers since long before I got into session mix wrestling myself. I have never had a session girl who had so much experience. Thank you for coming to Germany. I&#039;m really excited and impressed. She played with me on the mat and like . Indescribably good, so much fun and so few chances for me. Brilliant scissors and handles, with a smile, always friendly. Compliment, it doesn&#039;t get any better than that. She adapts very well and determines what happens. Learning and having fun, I was good at that <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f44d.png" alt="👍" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />! Although not tall physically, she has the strength and technique to totally dominate me. Thank you, big thank you for this experience and great feeling on the mat!

					<description><![CDATA[I had the honor and privilege of wrestling with the remarkable, strong,  skillful, and beautiful VeVe Lane on May 6, 2023. It was a phenomenal two-hours, and everything I hoped it would be. 

Although I’ve been a fan of mixed wrestling since I was in my teens, I never seriously considered booking a session to wrestle any of the women through the years. However, when I saw VeVe when she first popped up on the internets, all of that changed. I knew that if I ever did decide to session, it would HAVE to be with VeVe. 

After years of hesitation, and COVID, I finally took the plunge, and booked a flight to NY and a two-hour session with the great VeVe Lane. 

The first hour was to be three rounds of 15 minutes (with built in rests). The first she could use all her skills, the second round just chokes, smothers, and any kind of scissor, and the last round would she could only use headscissors. And for each round she had to predict how many submissions she would get. If I denied her that goal, I’d “win”. 

Because I was obsessed with workout leggings after seeing a mixed wrestling video of a gal destroying a guy while wearing one, I requested that VeVe wear some along with a top that showed off her impressive physique. She graciously  agreed to all the above. 

I told her from the start that I wanted to feel her full force; I wanted to know what it felt like to grapple with someone of her considerable skill. She came at me HARD! 

I cannot emphasize enough the amount of energy, force, effort, and sheer determination VeVe brings to grappling. It’s awesome and inspiring. It is clear that she intends to win any competition, regardless of the established rules; it’s etched in her face as she battles. She disregards any pain you manage to inflict - tapping just doesn’t happen with her. She fights through the pain or the hold, perseveres, and attacks!  

Needless to say she hit all of her predictions and then some. She applied several different types of choke holds that left my throat sore for days afterwards, a few arm bars, an Americana, a few body scissors and, especially in the last round, several headscissors that rang my bell, and made my neck sore and stiff for quite a while. 

And keep in mind that she did all of this while enjoying the hell out of her prowess and playfully mocking the lack of mine <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f602.png" alt="😂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />. 

The second hour was to be mostly fantasy style, starting with bondage wrestling, one of VeVe’s many specialties. Having no rope skills at all, not that I ever had a chance of winning, VeVe had me roped and tied in short order, and then spent the balance of the hour torturing me with facesitting, headscissors, HOM smothers and a few other twists. She even smothered me once with the underside of her knee! I had asked her to wear an outfit I had seen in one of her videos, sexy black lingerie with black thigh-highs. Again, she graciously agreed. I also asked for “glamour” VeVe, and there she was<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f525.png" alt="🔥" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f525.png" alt="🔥" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f525.png" alt="🔥" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />. 

You haven’t lived until you’ve had VeVe Lane rubbing her stockinged feet all over your face and telling you how badly she is going to womanhandle you. 

You want competitive? She will break you! You want fantasy? She can dish it out in buckets! VeVe role-plays with artistry and believability - a very great actor. In fact, I think anything VeVe tries to do, she endeavors to be the very best at it. She’s kind, funny, sincere, strong, competitive, and wonderful in every way. 

You WILL NOT REGRET booking a session with this remarkable woman. The only problem is, the more time you spend with her, the more time you want to spend with her. I cannot recommend VeVe highly enough. I cannot wait to see her again.  



(As an aside, if you read this VeVe, I was so excited to meet you, that I’m afraid I talked over you several times , interrupting your answers to my questions and being, in general, just really awkward. So sorry. I’ve been beating myself up about it since. Please chalk it up to finally meeting someone who I’ve been enamored of forever.)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Had a super fun session with VeVe a couple of weeks ago in europe. We had a scenario where I was an under-performing henchman which was great fun. She played the role to perfection.
She radiates positive energy and it was a complete blast to roll around the mats for twenty minutes or so before being completely overwhelmed due to the huge gap in skill and fitness levels.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Veve finally came back to Europe and I was lucky enough to meet her for the first time. As expected, when it was time to step up to such a legend, I was a bit impressed being naturally shy, though it might also have been an instinctive reaction knowing what was coming next... Thankfully Veve&#039;s bright and warm personality is great when it comes to make you feel comfortable, and as she said wrestling being a good way to break ice, I knew from there that the session was going to get better minute by minute.
Despite the experience and skill gap between us, I was mesmerized by how easy she made everything she did look so effortless. It was obvious Veve wasn&#039;t going all out on my poor wimpy body, even though she really loved making me squirm, but she definetely knew how to toy with a lesser opponent. For example, with her devastating scissors, which need no introduction, Veve used to squeeze me a few times before locking me up properly and applying a violent pressure, I ende up tapping mere seconds after. It went like this for the whole two hours. I stopped defending myself at one point, knowing I had been bested and humbled, but at least it came at the hands of a true expert! 
It was a truly enjoyable session, I was really happy to find so much chemistry with Veve, maybe the body worship played in my favor... It was also very nice to see her smirk, at times amused, at times swaggering, never disappearing off of Veve&#039;s beautiful face :)
Despite living quite away from her, the time I spent with Veve definetely made me want to see her again. There&#039;s no way you should miss any opportunity with her!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Had an amazing session with Veve today in London. She’s an absolute star and I was a bit starstruck I must admit!

She was really bubbly warm and friendly, and put me at waste quickly. We had agreed on a semi comp/domination session with the possibility of Veve bringing out the ropes at some point!

Well…I had no chance and I’m 5’9 and 17 stone. She had way too much skill and power for me and I absolutely tried my best to resist!

Once she had me down on the mats she kept me there - switching between various scissors, forced sweaty foot smothers/worship and lots and lots of squirmy facesitting. Not only would she sit on my face, she’d also grind sensually against it, every now and then giving me a split second of air before sitting back down and continuing. She even said “Pussy. Not only can I sit on your face whenever I desire, I can also ride it.” Bloody hell.

She got the ropes out towards the end, bound my hands and feet, and continued to ridicule me whilst squeezing and smothering the life out of me.

Session ended with victory poses and with her toes forcing me to suck and deepthroat them. Her final words. “Yes, stick to something you’re good at, like toe sucking, because it sure ain’t wrestling!”

I will never ever forget today. She was kind enough to allow a selfie too.

What a skilled wrestler she is, and more importantly, a fantastic lady.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In a sea of well deserved positive reviews, how could I possibly make this one stand out? I think the first thing I should say is that I&#039;m probably the most difficult client that a session girl could have. My first session description to Miss Lane was nearly 20 typed pages. My second session description was 11 typed pages. Yes, yesterday I met Miss Lane for the second time.  

My ideal session entails many elements of the session experience including role playing, stand up fighting, ground fighting, domination, and certain aspects of fantasy wrestling.  I realize when I&#039;m typing these descriptions, that I really don&#039;t even know what I want half the time.  But Miss Lane totally got it!!

Last night (12/29/2022), I knocked on the door. She opened and was decked out, waaa! (I&#039;m gasping for air as I reminisce), in a body hugging minidress with a pair of red pumps.  WOW! WOW! WOW!!!!!!!  My heart rate soared. I had trouble stringing together 3 words.  We quickly dove into role playing (per my request). Just like our first session, she remembered EVERYTHING!!   

As I noted above, the description is quite lengthy, which, by the way, is why I insist on tipping nicely for it.  So I&#039;m being very brief here.  

After she kicked off her heels we engaged in standup fighting. Keep in mind, as you read, this is all strictly role playing. Even the standup fighting part was a bit of a performance. That said, she easily dodged and parried everything that I threw and countered with a KO combo of her own. I was subjected to kicks, knees, and open palm strikes, some of which landed at the base of my sternum and hence, knocking the wind out of me.  She did trips and hip throws. Instead of pouncing on her floored victim, she smugly pranced about like a model on a runway, allowing him (me) to fully recover and get back to his feet.  The showboating is neither light nor playful, but rather disdainfully &quot;in your face.&quot;   Infuriated by her smug, nonchalant, and cocky attitude, I got back to my feet and charged with bad intentions only to quickly suffer the same fate.

After several knockdowns she stood directly above me and did a little striptease, letting her amazing dress slide down her amazing body and drop down on her beaten boy. Decked out in a tiny bikini, she began to showcase her painful jiu jitsu game.  I was choked and strangled (there IS a difference). I was arm barred and neck cranked. 

Until this point her demeanor was smug and even indifferent, as if the current situation did not require her full attention.  But suddenly, her demeanor became more threatening. Being a good fighter in itself is not enough to invoke fear in others. Hence, Miss Lane&#039;s character is suddenly more frightening. Pinned either to the floor or against the wall, vicious face slaps and hair pulling is alternated with a strong clasp of the chin as she lays down the law.   She also began to incorporate elements of &quot;fantasy wrestling.&quot;  And the humiliation tactics were horribly degrading.  

Like I said, my ideal session involves many different elements of the session wrestling experience.  One thing that Miss Lane may have ruined was any desire to have a session with another girl.  ;) I just wish we lived closer. 

One more thing. If you&#039;re interested in my story shoot me your email address. I have several. No charge.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Veve is one of the very best sessioners on the planet. This isn&#039;t meant to scare you, because everyone in the sessioning world should be so lucky and go run to session with her. But the truth is, she&#039;s an extraordinarily elite athlete, she will kick your ass, and she will enjoy making you lose. She will literally invent new ways on the fly to making you tap, while ensuring you never have a chance of getting her to tap. She&#039;s the strongest pound for pound individual I&#039;ve ever encountered, and I had 3 inches and 40 pounds on her. We sessioned for nearly two hours at full comp and she barely broke a sweat before her full day of 4-5 more sessions afterward, while I was totally exhausted at the end. She&#039;s also super sexy and a sweetheart who cares about her craft and making your session the best you&#039;ve ever had. Again, fair warning to anyone who challenges her: you will very likely lose badly, and you&#039;ll enjoy every minute of it.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[So first session…. First review (also if you can book with her do it) 

so I sessioned with VeVe a few weeks ago and it was everything I wanted and more.  She was super fun, super funny (and amazingly hot).  Going in I knew she’d kick my ass (pro &#062; non pro) but she made me feel like she worked for it,  she also gave me tips on how the moves work, why they work and how to kinda of escape them.  She caught me a bunch of times and then kinda of explained how and why after wards (wearing her like a back back might of been the finest thing in middle school but not now) but yeah.  Looking forward to seeing her again for her next west coast trip and hopefully I can get more the one pin // submission out of her]]></description>
