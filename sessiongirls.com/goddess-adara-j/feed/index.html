					<description><![CDATA[I had an awesome session when Goddess Adara visited Chicago.  I agree wholeheartedly with everything snkstr says, esp. &quot;WOW!&quot;  Yes, she is gorgeous, but you already knew that from the pictures.  Mad skills, yep.  But best of all is her devilish personality - just the right combination of evil, taunting and being fun.  I think she read exactly what I wanted and adjusted to that, within her style.  I definitely got the sense that if I wanted more sadistic, she would have cheerfully done that.  I&#039;m eager to see her again!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Had a fantasy/semi competitive session with the Goddess Adara yesterday and all I can say is WOW! Easy communication and a pleasure to deal with. Adara is very detailed and makes sure she knew exactly what I was looking for in a session. Trust me, she is even more beautiful and exotic than her pictures show. She is also very strong with  a very nice athletically toned body with just the right amount of muscle. I requested certain holds and some trash talking, and she was on it. Do yourself a favor and book this Goddess, you won&#039;t regret. I&#039;m already looking forward to my next session.]]></description>
