					<description><![CDATA[I was extremely fortunate to have a wrestling session with Allie yesterday and it was superb!  

Her communication was excellent throughout the setting up and booking.  I didn’t give her a lot of warning, but she found time to fit me into her busy schedule.  She was always making sure to let me know all the details and to answer any questions I may have had.  When she met me at the door, she is every bit as beautiful as her pictures indicate and I have to say she has a terrific smile.  

I was very anxious and nervous as I am quite inexperienced at this, and she put me at ease relatively quickly. The studio is great, with room for us to grapple around and have a roll.  The emphasis was on safety and fun, which I can say for certain is exactly what happened.  She is very easy to talk to and the conversations between falls were quite varied and came naturally to her.  It helped me tremendously in loosening up and getting out of my shell.

I had asked for a fantasy / semi competitive wrestle, and it was every bit of that.  I am admittedly a novice (zero real experience) wrestler and while I am about twice her weight her skill offset that very easily.     She’s stronger than she looks and pretty fast.   When I wrestled timidly, she chewed me up and the few times I managed to get aggressive she was skilled enough to turn the tables on me.   She has a pretty mean choke, which I found myself in far too often, and got me in a few headscissors which were tight, strong, and almost immediately had me tapping.   I have no doubt if she wanted to she could really put a truly impressive squeeze on someone!  Someday I may have to put that to the test.  

I held up ok for a while but her stamina and the great shape she is in eventually took its toll.  I got her a couple times, but I won’t pretend I outskilled her on any level.  I basically outsized her and got myself into a couple of superior positions.  Beyond that she was pretty much in control throughout and rarely threatened by me.  She has a couple of ‘go to’ moves that I’ll let folks find out for themselves when they see her, but they happen incredibly fast and strong and, for me at least, that was that for a particular fall.  And she did all of these things with a fun smile and a bit of a sassy attitude that was difficult to get frustrated with.  A rare trait in my opinion.  I think she had plenty of sassy in reserve if it was needed. 

If I have a real regret, it is booking only 1 hour as it went by far too quickly.  There certainly will be a next time for me and I am going to rectify that oversight for sure.   I have a lot of falls to catch up on! 

If you are an experienced wrestler, have 50 or 60 lbs on her, want to wrestle a full-on competitive match, she probably isn’t for you.  If you want to have a fun and enjoyable roll with a fit woman with skills enough to knock an average guy on his ass, then I would highly recommend her.  If you are thinking of trying her, you will not be disappointed.  My opinion is she’s a hidden gem in this particular session area.

Thank you Allie!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I hooked up for a session with Allie Heart- and I never fathomed her to be so deceptively strong. The ladies always greatly appreciate my visits to the studio with all the charm I carry into the session. Which is why I was shocked how much of a beating Allie laid on me, giving up around 70 pounds. Fighting from our knees, she inflicted a lot of damage to my windpipes, jaw, neck and ears with her powerful legs and even her upper body strength astounded me. Strongest girl I’ve wrestled in her weight class- and I’ve tangled with a bunch who are infamous characters in this industry. Allie is a gorgeous and sweet gal, but a little full of herself- but it’s difficult to cut her down to size. Next time I’ll be better prepared, I assured her. And boy does she know bondage! She’s got a lot of  experience in that realm, as well as having her feet worshipped. And as always, her and her cohorts are always professional, prompt in returning emails, and possess a clean, private, and safe environment. I didn’t think Allie Heart had legitimate wrestling ability as part of her repertoire, but she’s a savage I can confidently attest.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I recently had a session with Allie at her facility in the Northampton, Ma. area and it was fantastic. Since I am a novice wrestler at best I requested a beginner/fantasy type wrestling session and she provided that type of session which emphasized fun.  Allie is a very good wrestler and is just a super nice woman which made the session even better.  She also provides a spacious wrestling room with mats which is also a plus.  In summary I strongly recommend Allie for anyone looking to book a session.]]></description>
