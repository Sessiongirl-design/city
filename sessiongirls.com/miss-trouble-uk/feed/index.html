					<description><![CDATA[I just had my first session with Trouble today.
What a woman! She is very easy to talk to and the session was very easy to set up.
We messaged back and forth during the two weeks leading up to the session which i found really pleasant.
On the session day we sat down and talked about who we are and what the session should entail. I had asked for wrestling and ballbusting, with ballbusting as my primary interest. I told Trouble beforehand that she could go quite hard. Turns out that she loves ballbusting, and had been looking forward to going hard.
Well she did, and i spent most of the session on the floor whimpering. But that didn&#039;t stop her, she used her grappling skills to pry my legs open and continue pounding my nuts with kicks, punches, knees and even getting submissions by squeezing my balls. All the while having fun and laughing sadistically at my predicament. She was very attentive and made sure i was okay during our session, even allowing to take a longer break while the nausea from all the nutshots subsided.
She is a very bubbly person and a fierce fighter. I would highly recommend her to anyone. If you are a newbie or a more experienced sessioner Trouble can definitely deliver.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This was my first session with Trouble, and my first visit to MWM&#039;s venue Trapdoor Dungeon. Both exceeded my already very high expectations.

First impressions? Trouble is drop dead gorgeous. She greeted me in a sexy thong bikini, but offered me fetish wear alternatives and an amazing superheroine costume - I was like a kid in a candy shop!

She&#039;s amazingly friendly, open and down to earth - I felt like I&#039;d known her forever, and felt very comfortable with her - I didn&#039;t feel comfortable for long, though!

I was looking forward to being on the receiving end of some mean, aggressive treatment - and Trouble delivered in spades. Arm bars, scissors, facesitting, chokes and a flurry of belly punches. I definitely got the mean treatment I wanted, but Trouble was lovely with it - checking in on me, but also laughing at my pathetic performance. I wanted some Trouble, and wow did I get some.

It wasn&#039;t long before I was completely done - but that wasn&#039;t the end of it. Trouble was determined to make me her bitch, and forced me to swallow and lick her sweaty feet - she completely owned me, and I loved every second of it.

Trouble&#039;s an incredible woman - stunningly gorgeous, but with an amazingly feminine but incredibly strong body. Her arms and leg muscles are out of this world, as my aching ribs and kneck can testify. She&#039;s also an incredibly skilled fighter - I don&#039;t kid myself that I&#039;d ever stand a chance against her, but she makes it such fun trying.

I&#039;m hooked. Can&#039;t wait to get myself into Trouble again very soon.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I arranged a session with Miss Trouble in London - attracted by her martial arts skills and having seen her on videos some years ago.
I confess, I was concerned not to see any reviews here and now, after my session, I am amazed rather than concerned.
In 25 years at this, the session with Miss Trouble was out and out one of my best ever.
I was right to have paid attention to her Judo and BJJ skills, she is fast and strong.   She doesn&#039;t give you a chance to formulate defence or attack and she was all over me from the start.  Whatever I tried was instantly countered and I found myself in trouble.
She has a perfect mix of muscularity and femininity and her grappling skills are up there with VeVe in New York and Kaos in London.
On top of all of that, she has a fabulous London accent and the most engaging personality.]]></description>
