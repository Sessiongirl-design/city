					<description><![CDATA[Yesterday I had an semi Competitive session with Amata for the first time ever and I had so much fun. I had some confidence with my strenght but she easily pushed me to the ground and put me in all kinds of submissions. Whenever I tried to escape I could tell she was toying with me and was enjoying watching me struggle. The last hakf hour I got a bit tired and we turned down the intensity.

All in all, She was very caring and very pretty and I loved every second of it!!
Definitely recommend for everyone!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Amata&#039;s mixed wrestling session was awesome! She&#039;s super strong and makes sure you&#039;re always safe. She listens to what you want and makes the whole experience great.

Her wrestling room is amazing - it has the best mats, lots of space, soft to fall on, and even secret mirrors! We did some semi-competitive wrestling where she used her strong legs to scissor me, pin me down, and stretch me out. She also doesn&#039;t just go for quick and easy submissions just because she easily could, but gives you chances to escape only for you to realize, there is no way out anyways xD 
The second part of our session focused on scissoring, where Amata demonstrated her leg power impressively. Even though her ankles weren&#039;t 100%, she still gave it her all. I had to already tap out at 70% of her standing headscissor power, making me wonder about her full strength!

Her cats are a delight too - so sweet and well-mannered, reflecting Amata&#039;s care for them.

At the end, she surprised me by trying some acroyoga poses. She&#039;s naturally good at it, lifting me up easily even though I weigh 92 kg. She could even lift me on her shoulders and squat and spin me around like I&#039;m nothing!

I hope I can have another session with her. I&#039;ll keep working on my neck strength, and hopefully, her ankles will be better too. I&#039;m looking forward to seeing her again and trying out her full power! :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Today, I had a boxing session with the amazing Amata.
Location is very easy, there is a metro station just 5 minutes by walking. Amata gives instructions.
 
Amata was wearing a beautiful japenease black yukata and I was astonished by how tall she is (1.80m).
She receive me in her dojo which is a masterpiece ! You have tatamis, lights for the video, some fitness stuff to do a warmup, a boxing bag.
At the back, there is a place where you can rest a drink a nice glass of water serving by your favorite host : Amata himself.
 
We talked a little bit and I was kind of a meeting with an old friend (most sexy friend ever met). We laugh together. Then we decide it&#039;s action time !
 
She sets the camera, she turn on the lights (there are spots like on a shooting scene, these materiels cost a lot !). And then, after she changes for the fight,
I was amazed by her outstanding sexy outfit. There were also boxing gloves already prepared.
 
We started gently but quickly it gets more intense. Amata shows her moves, you can see that she has experience in boxing moves and enough stamina to make the whole fight.
Punches are exchanged and we made a lot of clinches. Sometimes I hit on her body (because she was taller then me, my only target was her body) and I notice she has serious abdominals.
Even if I try harder (after making sure she&#039;s okay with that), I still was impressed by her muscles.
 
An absolutely amazing session with her ! She is as nice as you can dream about it, really enjoying the session and I spent a really good time during that session.
I highly recommend her. I do boxing on all my session but I can assure she has serious skills on wrestling.
 
Thanks a lot Amata, I&#039;m sure I will come again to Amsterdam to see you again !!!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Saturday i had a session with Amata.
She is so a nice person as she can really beat you easy. Her powers are unbelievable and with her fighting skills, I love it. I am a man 1,90m long and I am not a very strong man but i can lift a washing machine so i am not that weak.
When she puts you down you just stay that easy there wasn&#039;t even a little movement when i try to wrestle back against her.
I just knew that she could beat me easy, but I still have to land on earth that she can beat you that easy.
She can make a big man weak like shit.
Thanks Amata! It was great.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My meeting with Amata was my first wrestling session ever, and therefore I review from a more emotional than technical point of view.
When I got out of the elevator, she stood already there and I was flashed by her radiant smile. I felt immediately totally secure and began to open my mind for this extraordinary experience. After a few words exchanged, I changed clothes and then returned to her dojo.
The situation seemed totally unreal to me: in front of me that wonderful woman that I should wrestle now. I took her hands carefully, they were strong and full of power. Then I tried to catch and to move her, but I was unable to move her even for one millimetre. I was astonished and impressed by that unbelievable strong and hard body (but very feminine too). In the other second, I found myself on the ground caught in a hold. &#039;Now you are trapped&#039;, she said. Indeed. &#039;Will you not try to get out?&#039;. I tried. &#039;That leads you nowhere.&#039; Then she submitted me. I tapped out in half a second, but I felt rarely so intense and so good. This happened a few times. I could nothing against her and she then submitted me. And Amata has such an ironical sense of humour that I particularly love.
Luckily we had a break with water and some glucose, and we talked a bit. Amata is such an intelligent woman too. And she can motivate you, gives always some advice and some good words.
But she is a real fighter too. She wants your submission and she will get it. She will never let you win! And even me could see immediately what a remarkable fighter she is (in fact she is a black belt in Judo).
Amata is a wonderful woman: beautiful, nice, intelligent. I enjoyed every second of our encounter and it is one of the greater experiences in my life.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I had a session with Amata a couple of days ago. When she opened the door I was instantly stunned by her. What an appearance !! We did a one sided beatdown session with some trampling as well. When the session began I was so overwhelmed with her power. I never met such a strong hot girl and I will never meet someone with that power ever again, that is for sure.
She held me in some kind of leg lock behind my back and arms, she did some deadly headscissors and throwed me through the room and on to the mats. At some point I was a little scared (but in a good way), but she always comforted me and was also nice to me. I found myself wonderfully caught in her web the whole time.
Amata thank you for an amazing experience ! Hope we meet again for another session...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Recently, I had the pleasure of participating in a BDSM session with Amata. Our initial arrangement was for a competitive wrestling match that would gradually transition into a BDSM domination scenario, a dynamic well-suited to my personal preferences as a switch. As a submissive, I enjoy the added challenge of being a &#039;brat&#039;, purposely making the situation difficult for the dominant.

Given Amata&#039;s proven strenght and skillset from our past wrestling sessions, I had no doubt she would be able to best me in combat. However, I was intrigued to see how will she cope with challenges of BDSM domination and, particularly, my deliberate brattiness. To increase the complexity of the task, I opted for a carte blanche approach, only providing a few hard limits and forgoing any script or pre-set roleplay scenario.

In the interest of preserving the element of surprise for future participants, I will refrain from detailing the exact events of our session. However, I can attest that she not only managed to handle me with aplomb but also completely outmaneuvered my attempts at brattiness. Her method of making me submit was both intense and highly arousing.

I can confidently state, without a shadow of a doubt, that this was one of the most memorable, if not THE most memorable, BDSM sessions I have ever experienced. And considering my extensive history within various roles of the BDSM community, this is no small claim.

Amata possesses a natural knack for reading people, an invaluable skill that serves her well in both wrestling and BDSM scenarios. In fact, it is in BDSM where it especially comes to light, enabling her to effectively dominate and control the dynamic. Truly amazing!

In conclusion, our session was an absolute delight, and I am eagerly looking forward to our next encounter.

Cheers y’all!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I am writing two days after a two hours competitive session with Amata, in her super spacious place in Amsterdam. 
Don’t know where to start… 
I am a 34 year old man, played handball my whole life (semi professionally for 5 years) and still playing, plus going to the gym 2-3 times a week. 1m81, 84kg, even if I’m slowing down since a couple years with trainings, I consider myself a quite trained person (or at least considered myself before that session). 
Well, two days after, I still feel some pain in my fingers and right elbow. 
And I’m not counting how many bruises I have from this session, but it’s more than 10. 

Although I have no experience in combat sport, I have met several sessioners and I have to say, it’s the first time I have this feeling… 
We started talking about how we got there, and started the session with an armwrestling. 
I’m lefthanded, she’s righthanded but because of some little pain in her elbow, we did only with right arm.

From what I had seen on her pictures and from previous wins with bigger girls I thought I would win easily. Little doubt when I saw her biceps while she was tying her hairs, I remember I thought, “wow nice biceps”, and then “ha, are they bigger than mine?” they were. 

So we start, and because I would never want to hurt someone I do a session with, I go easy. 
After 2-3 seconds increasing the power, we stabilize and I decide to go almost all the way… She doesn’t move. 
And when I was starting to realize it would be harder than I thought, she goes all the way, and put my arm down as I would do with my 10 year old nephew… 
What a surprise!!! 
I ask immediately for a rematch as I thought she got me a bit by surprise and would never beat me again like this. I was wrong. 
There was just no match and she was just toying me before putting my arm down in 1 second when she wanted to end the game. 
We did not try left arm, but I think that even injured, she can, if not beat me, resist more than I have resisted on right arm. 
Just incredible. 
I have a big kink for biceps and armwrestling… and that was a great start. 

Then we go for wrestling. As per armwresling, I start easy, but quickly understand that I should give everything. First fight ends in 2 min with my submission. 
Second, lasted a bit more as I was taking advantage at first, but because I did not want to hurt her, I leave my chance to win and she ends up submitting me again. 
I try to go stronger on third fight but with her strength and experience, she also wins easily the third fight… 
Time for a water break. 
The only advantage I may had at that point (if you really want to find something at my advantage) is that she seemed a bit more tired than me. 
4th – 5th – 6th fights … she always win. 
At some point she had me on a schoolgirl pin, squeezed my hands and said… “maybe your hands are a bit stronger than mine” …
That was right, but because she took a better grip I was almost asking her to stop squeezing my hands. Did not ask her to stop, and that’s why I have this pain in my fingers even 2 days after our session… 
However in a strength test with hands I won, that was the only thing I was better at.

We fought again 3-4 times and I did manage to submit her once, while she was wining quite easily the other fights. 
Actually, the only time I won is because she did not fight seriously at the beginning. 
On 10 fights if she wants she wins easily 10 times.

I had already lost against women.. But I have never felt so powerless, so unable to do anything and so surprised, as from her height / weight and pictures, I really thought I would have beaten her at both wrestling and armwrestling… And I was even thinking to beat her easily. 
I am still chocked. 
Greatest session. 
Just thank you, and hope to see you again.]]></description>

I try to go stronger on third fight but with her strength and experience, she also wins easily the third fight…<br />
Time for a water break.<br />
The only advantage I may had at that point (if you really want to find something at my advantage) is that she seemed a bit more tired than me.<br />
4th – 5th – 6th fights … she always win.<br />
At some point she had me on a schoolgirl pin, squeezed my hands and said… “maybe your hands are a bit stronger than mine” …<br />
That was right, but because she took a better grip I was almost asking her to stop squeezing my hands. Did not ask her to stop, and that’s why I have this pain in my fingers even 2 days after our session…<br />
However in a strength test with hands I won, that was the only thing I was better at.</p>
<p>We fought again 3-4 times and I did manage to submit her once, while she was wining quite easily the other fights.<br />
Actually, the only time I won is because she did not fight seriously at the beginning.<br />
On 10 fights if she wants she wins easily 10 times.</p>
<p>I had already lost against women.. But I have never felt so powerless, so unable to do anything and so surprised, as from her height / weight and pictures, I really thought I would have beaten her at both wrestling and armwrestling… And I was even thinking to beat her easily.<br />
I am still chocked.<br />
Greatest session.<br />
Just thank you, and hope to see you again.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[I met her a month ago in Amsterdam where she has a well equipped room with large and comfortable floor mat. Despite a serious though temporary back pain, she had maintained the session we had fixed several weeks in advance which shows how professional and reliable she is. Concerning her skills I can say that not only she has enough technique and strength to overpower any man who tries to resist her, but she also knows how to rule the game by playing with her victim like a cat with a mouse. I had asked for a fantasy wrestling focused on a &quot;role play&quot; that I will not describe here but I can say that she gave me exactly what I expected. I met many female wrestlers over the past ten years, but in the end it is Amata who gave me what I was waiting for all that time. In any case, don&#039;t hesitate to book a session with her, it will certainly be the best time you will have before long.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve had a second session with Amata some time ago, thought I should write something. What I would really like to stress this time is Amata&#039;s also so kind, lovely, witty, smart, and good at &quot;reading&quot; your reaction even if you&#039;re too shy to say something or don&#039;t even really realize it yourself yet. Always coming up with fun ideas. I didn&#039;t ever feel even close to bored, not for a single second. Afterwards I felt so much better, too. And she is also so good at being careful and not damaging you. At some moments I felt some hard punishment, but nothing did hurt since the next day. True professional.
I will very likely sign up again, multiple times.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Had a session with Amata recently. I had a few sessions with others some time ago, and Amata is by far the best, I&#039;d even say for me it&#039;s no longer interesting to consider sessioning with anyone else. Impressive skills and strength, and a charming personality and of course looks (better than on photos btw). Like an angel from heaven or I don&#039;t know what&#039;s a good way to describe. I&#039;m a fairly big dude and she could overpower me so easily like I&#039;m a baby, while being careful not to hurt me except the good kind of pain. She also did different nice things to me, I won&#039;t go into detail. I also was introduced to Spontaneously Tying Knots, a tactic I have no idea how to defend from because I didn&#039;t even notice how it happened.  
My conversational skills are limited but she also had no problem with it, we had a bit of a chat and we&#039;d occasionally crack some jokes and stuff, awesome. I&#039;d go again eventually. Also I can confirm, what other comments said here, it&#039;s true. I see why it can be hard to believe until you see for yourself, but it&#039;s true.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I had an amazing session with Amata! She is very athletic and solidly built, and is also the perfect height (6 feet tall). We started off with a light semi-competitive match, and as soon as she was on top of me, I couldn&#039;t get her off. She even just held me down with her legs and body in full mount without using her arms, and I still couldn’t move her. 

After I was exhausted, which was pretty quick, we moved into a session in which she put me in a series of holds, which was a lot of fun. So she is definitely skilled as a wrestler and grappler, but she&#039;s also very good for a lighter type of session.

I can&#039;t recommend Amata enough! She&#039;s not only extraordinarily beautiful, but she&#039;s super nice, and certainly not a clock watcher. I&#039;m definitely going to see her again whenever possible!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Imagine an Angelina Jolie look-alike Lara Croft in flesh and blood offering wrestling sessions. No, it’s not your ultimate fantasy dream scenario, it’s a super accurate description of what’s happening right now in real life in Amsterdam (actually even better: Amata would kick Lara Croft’s butt easily lol).

I’ve sessioned with some of the top ladies and legends in the industry. With all due respect, none of them can compare to Amata, as she possesses the full package: world class martial arts background (she was internationally undefeated in her discipline), 6 feet tall, perfectly proportionate athletic figure to admire and worship for days, insane strenght (well beyond what her figure shows), top model good looks, enchanting smile and easy going personality. Plus she has the best possible capacity for a session: super spacious place, fully equipped with everything needed to enhance your session experience, including video camera settings for those interested in recording the encounter.

As for our meeting, it was the first time in my life that I felt completely powerless to do anything while grappling with a woman: I’m not even talking about winning, just giving her a barely decent match. She was literally playing with me despite my all out efforts. Too skilled, too strong for me. Actually, strong is an understatement: can you believe she destroyed me armwrestling right and left arm like I’ve never been destroyed before? And she lifted my 105kg body performing squat with me over her shoulders like I weighted nothing (worth noticing that no other lady had ever accepted to lift me before due to my big size)? I won’t blame you if you don’t believe me, cause I still don’t believe it either lol.   

Whoever loves session wrestling should put meeting Amata at the very top of their bucket list! Even the ones who claim to have never been beaten in sessions, Amata might be your first time, give her a try if you only get a chance to visit Amsterdam. She says she genuinely enjoys real competitive matches more than anything else, only issue is she is hardly able to find real competition for her. 

One last remark that might scare the hell out of you: she has only recently started sessioning after a long 8 years break from physical and martial arts training. Now she says she is back to training and aims to reach again her full potential, confidently estimating that she has room to improve at least another 50% strenght and athleticism wise from her current status… Imagine the unbeatable beast I’ve just described being 50% stronger: that’s literally Wonder Woman lol!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://sessiongirls.com/amata/#comment-2104&quot;&gt;iwillpinu&lt;/a&gt;.

Yes, we arm wrestled. Best out of 3. I agreed to using the right arm even though left is my dominant side, because I obviously did not expect to lose. (Arm wrestled with a body builder lady before and won) I underestimated Amata because of her more athletic and less body building type of physique. It sounds unrealistic but Amata had a stronger pull (and much more consistency over time). She won 3/3. But I don’t know what the outcome would be if we used our left arms. This was during the first session. After the rope wrestling this time I was too exhausted to even think of arm wrestling. Thus.. not completely sure. But I felt she got even stronger in wrestling so not sure if I want to challenge her again haha.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Before writing a review I&#039;d like to highlight couple of things about myself, so that YOU as a reader can have a better insight on what to expect and to have a better feel on plausibility of what I wrote about Amata.

I&#039;m 28 years old, in good health and fairly better then average physical condition - or in other words - I&#039;m a sporty type. In general I&#039;m competitive and I can hardly refuse a challenge, and in most cases I&#039;m quite confident about myself in terms of physical competitions. Among other sports I also have some martial arts background (Taekwondo green belt and I do BJJ as a hobby nowadays). Other then that (for those to whom matters) I&#039;m kinky (aren&#039;t we all, duh?) and in terms of kinky world I&#039;m a switch.

So let me get into this:

My first session with Amata was actually quite shocking experience. I wasn&#039;t expecting nor was I prepared for such superiority tehnique-wise, and on the contrary to my initial beliefs I couldn&#039;t compensate for it with raw strenght (one of the reasons for this is because I&#039;m still not even sure which of us has the edge strenght-wise hahah..sounds funny and unbelievable but that&#039;s how it is!). The next session we had I was convinced I simply must disregard the fact she is a woman, and I must give all in if I want to be anywhere near winning situation - which I did, but after our second session it was first time I came down to terms that I actually did go all out (even though I probably did the first time as well, just couldn&#039;t accept it) - but this didn&#039;t affect the result at all - she still slayed me.

Our next session was a &#039;rope wrestling session&#039; or a &#039;bondage session&#039; if you will. So we agreed the terms and regulations up front, and we made a deal that the goal is to tie up the opponent (using ropes) to the point where the winner can easily go open themselves a bottle of beer with the loser being unable to move from where he/she was put. This session was a total massacre! So those of you who have experience with wrestling/grappling probably know that after about 10 minutes of decent competitive fight with a worthy oponent you get fairly tired and a short break comes in handy, right? Well this lasted nearly an hour of continuous fight! She was NICE here so she didn&#039;t apply or take advantage of her superior technique in holds, submissions etc.(as that would kill the fun and let her win waay too easily)  but she confronted me, so to say, like a &quot;man&quot; and went all physical and made it a rough fight with ropes which was suuupperrr funn and also an awesome workout!!! At very beginning I took the initiative of trying to tie her up, but this proved to be quite hard to do (even though I&#039;m not a noob with bondaging due to my kinky side), and exposed me too much, so very quickly I had to take more defensive stance and spent the rest of the time trying to prevent her from bondaging me, which at certain points felt like being abused haha (not in bad terms of course!)...eh to keep this story short, it was crazy fun but eventually after a crazy long and thrillingly fun run, I was forced (read: had my arms and legs tied up) to have a short break while she went to refresh herself (read: open the forementioned bottle).

So let me get to my conclusion: Amata is a very nice, openminded, forthcoming and understanding person, respectful and very very fun, and she shall be treated as such and absolutely deserves the same respect back, because when these conditions are met she is more then capable with providing you whatever kind of fun comes to your mind. (Except of course, she will never lose to you, I don&#039;t think you could even bribe her for that ;) )]]></description>

I wasn&#8217;t expecting nor was I prepared for such superiority tehnique-wise, and on the contrary to my initial beliefs I couldn&#8217;t compensate for it with raw strenght (one of the reasons for this is because I&#8217;m still not even sure which of us has the edge strenght-wise hahah..sounds funny and unbelievable but that&#8217;s how it is!). The next session we had I was convinced I simply must disregard the fact she is a woman, and I must give all in if I want to be anywhere near winning situation &#8211; which I did, but after our second session it was first time I came down to terms that I actually did go all out (even though I probably did the first time as well, just couldn&#8217;t accept it) &#8211; but this didn&#8217;t affect the result at all &#8211; she still slayed me.</p>
<p>Our next session was a &#8216;rope wrestling session&#8217; or a &#8216;bondage session&#8217; if you will. So we agreed the terms and regulations up front, and we made a deal that the goal is to tie up the opponent (using ropes) to the point where the winner can easily go open themselves a bottle of beer with the loser being unable to move from where he/she was put. This session was a total massacre! So those of you who have experience with wrestling/grappling probably know that after about 10 minutes of decent competitive fight with a worthy oponent you get fairly tired and a short break comes in handy, right? Well this lasted nearly an hour of continuous fight! She was NICE here so she didn&#8217;t apply or take advantage of her superior technique in holds, submissions etc.(as that would kill the fun and let her win waay too easily)  but she confronted me, so to say, like a &#8220;man&#8221; and went all physical and made it a rough fight with ropes which was suuupperrr funn and also an awesome workout!!! At very beginning I took the initiative of trying to tie her up, but this proved to be quite hard to do (even though I&#8217;m not a noob with bondaging due to my kinky side), and exposed me too much, so very quickly I had to take more defensive stance and spent the rest of the time trying to prevent her from bondaging me, which at certain points felt like being abused haha (not in bad terms of course!)&#8230;eh to keep this story short, it was crazy fun but eventually after a crazy long and thrillingly fun run, I was forced (read: had my arms and legs tied up) to have a short break while she went to refresh herself (read: open the forementioned bottle).</p>
<p>So let me get to my conclusion: Amata is a very nice, openminded, forthcoming and understanding person, respectful and very very fun, and she shall be treated as such and absolutely deserves the same respect back, because when these conditions are met she is more then capable with providing you whatever kind of fun comes to your mind. (Except of course, she will never lose to you, I don&#8217;t think you could even bribe her for that 😉 )</p>
