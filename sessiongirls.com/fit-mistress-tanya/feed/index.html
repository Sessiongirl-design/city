					<description><![CDATA[I had a session with Empress Tanya back in November (sorry this took so long!). 

Empress Tanya was very friendly and easy to work with during the booking process, and we established a session that would involve mummification, trampling, choking, suffocation/smothering, and (since I mentioned I had a little bit of experience in impact that I was open to exploring more), some caning. Pain thresholds and boundaries were discussed as well. 

The session, itself? Woooow! I was wrapped ankle to shoulder in pallet wrap. Empress Tanya made sure to pull on it tightly as I rotated to ensure it stretched and really constricted me. Breathing in deeply was an effort! Then I was shoved into a mattress and it was on!

Alas, I panicked and chickened out of an inflatable latex breath control hood Empress Tanya started to place over my head, but it remained over my eyes for the duration of the session, so there was no telling what was coming, or when. And I found out quickly that what was coming was an absolute deluge of stomps and jumps all over my body! Empress Tanya is an absolute bundle of energy who didn’t appear to tire out at all, and I was stuck there, unable to avoid it (not that I’d want to!). 

Between all this was some scissor-holds, buttdrops (to the torso, neck and face), some smothering, caning, and the most painful “Asian walking massage” to my quads and calves I have ever had. All while remaining completely wrapped up and unable to move. Lots of laugh-crying and swearing on my part, met with plenty of evil giggles from Empress Tanya, and absolutely no mercy. She is a true sadist!

When all was said and done, I was nursing cuts to the inside of my lip, bruises in various places - front and back -  from the caning, reeeeaally sore leg muscles, and it hurt to swallow for a full week. 
10/10, would totally get destroyed by Empress Tanya again!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Empress Tanya is a strong and skilled wrestler who is trained in bjj. I have had 2 wrestling sessions with her that were at the high end of semi-competitive. She is very adept at defense and if you don&#039;t know what you are doing then you may find her difficult to get an offensive advantage. In terms of her offense, she has a very good guillotine and a solid armbar attack. She would definitely prove a challenge for any guy who has no training in grappling. Highly recommend her for a semi&#039;comp wrestling match and she may well defeat you.]]></description>
