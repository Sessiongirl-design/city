					<description><![CDATA[Sessioned with Rox a few weeks ago in Sydney, everything went off smoothly and easily with perfect communication. We carried out the session the same day that I initially enquired which I felt was well beyond reasnoble expectation, we were also able to arrange a location that suited us both and the session was paid for in full prior.

 The session itself involved lift and carry and some wrestling. Rox was super fun and carried it out completely judgement free and open minded. I weigh close to 90kg and have played contact sports my whole life and gym regularly, Rox was able to submit me and overpower me relatively seamlessly. 

The lifts included a powerful shoulder ride with squats, fireman’s carry, sitting on her lap into a cradle carry and even a couple overhead press attempts as well as others that I am forgetting. Not at all a clock watcher and enjoys conversing and getting to know her clients.

Can also confirm that Rox is a stunner and saves the pretty face for those who will reach out to see her. She should be considered an asset to the session community and won’t be here forever so you should get her while you can, especially in Aus where there are not many session providers. I know I’ll definitely be booking again.]]></description>
