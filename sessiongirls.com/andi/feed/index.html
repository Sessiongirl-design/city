					<description><![CDATA[I met Constance  and Andi in Munich a few weeks ago. The communication with both of them before the session was very clear and easy. We have agreed on a semi competitive session with parts of domination.
At first I start with andi. At first I tried to fight back. But to be honest she quickly showed me my place and start to dominate me. After half an hour andi changed with Constance and she continue the session..and the domination.
Both women know exactly what they are doing. I had an amazing time with both of them. And they made sure that I got exactly what I wanted before the session. They are both very nice and friendly too. I can recommend them both and hope I will met them again.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Just met with Andi in Milwaukee. Wow! I read these reviews prior to seasoning with anyone for the first time, and the praise is at times so persistent it’s hard to take it beyond face value. But I am now writing one of those very reviews, and with Andi I get it. 

Andi is beautiful, strong, professional and a great communicator. Setting up the session was easy. I told her what I was into and provided some more general things  on what I look for.   

Andi is extremely skilled, and when she says she specializes in ko it’s practically an art form  she will offer instructions on what she’s going to do, what I think was unlike most session in regard to ko you’re really working as a team. It’s far more intimate, and above all else you can feel safe and really just let go.  
I’ve had many sessions, seldom if ever do I not have a great time. However, tonight with andi, this was an experience.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I just had a great doubles pro wrestling fantasy session with Constance and Andi Vicious. This was my second time with Constance and my first with Andi.

Andi tagged in first. She&#039;s tall and has a strong lean build and I was awestruck as she towered over me! We locked up and she put me in a headlock and easily took me down. Before I knew it I was trapped in a tight sleeper bodyscissors combo and tapping. She sat on my face and pinned me easily multiple times and then had me trapped and helpless with a breast smother. Andi impressed me with her strength too lifting me up and helpless in a backbreaker and then sapping my strength with a tight elevated bearhug.

Constance tagged in and we locked up with a test of strength. I thought I was winning and then she got me with a knee to the crotch and tenderized me with a couple of belly punches. She wrapped me up in a tight bearhug and then took me down to the mat. Constance sat on my face and as I knew from our last session once you&#039;re under that booty there&#039;s no breathing until you tap! Constance put me in her signature Constance grapevine move and crushed me with a reverse headscissors move she calls the washing machine, crushing my head between her powerful thighs and giving me a great view of her perfect round booty as she shook me back and forth.

Then they double teamed me and took turns pinning me, sitting on my face, scissoring, tickling, pinching my nipples and had all sorts of fun with me. I was totally helpless against both and them and all I could do was tap. Constance even finished a dessert she had from earlier, sharing with Andi while they both used me for a seat. We ended the session with some cuddling and lap sitting. Each lady took a turn to rock and comfort this defeated jobber on their lap.

It was such a fun match and I can’t wait to see either one, or even better both again!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I met Andi and Constance yesterday in the Cincinnati area for a tickling session. This isn&#039;t my first time with Constance (I&#039;ll say more about her in her review on her page), but this is the first time I&#039;ve met Andi. Andi was fantastic!

Setting up the session was quick. Both of them were easy and understanding to work with. Andi is very nice and professional. She has an incredible athletic body and I was blown away by her strength. She is silent and deadly (as a tickler)! Once she knows your spot, you&#039;re done, especially if she uses her chin on you! Both of these ladies worked me to death! With that being said, even though she is powerful, that doesn&#039;t mean she can&#039;t be ticklish. In fact, Andi is ticklish all over, some spots even moreso! She will turn into one of the biggest squirmers you&#039;ll ever meet once you find them.

Andi and Constance were a lot of fun and I would gladly see both ladies again when they are back in town. I highly recommend both if they ever stop by your city.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I met Andi today for the first time in London, as a duo with Constance. Andi is a tall and powerful yet very feminine blonde beauty, with awesome skills. Her scissors and drops are very dangerous; and she can do the splits on your neck in a way that makes not being able to breathe feel just fine. This clearly accomplished martial artist could obviously do real damage if she wanted to. I was so happy she could join this session, and would love to see her again. After an hour with her and Constance however, I will have to avoid sneezing or laughing for about three days.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Here’s all you need to know about Andi!
She was hurt during a session the night before n immediately got in contact to let me know she’d not be able to session the next day. She was as up front an honest as you can be as a person. So we hung out , talked, watched wrestling videos and it was so laid back and down to earth genuine that you could be in her position at the time. 
We will meet again!! And so should anyone else reading this if she comes to your city!  Trust me, she’s tough as hell and will toy with you, but girls like this that are honest and just truly “real” people,  need to be booked in every city they visit!
She’s awesome on the mats! And a better person in real life! Just proves she’s not that…” vicious “]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I just finished a 3 hour session with Andi Vicious and I had a great beat down.  Andi is stunningly beautiful, down to earth and an exceptional athlete.  I would rank her among the top 3 great women of session wrestling, Electra, Dez Desire, and of course the the queen herself VeVe Lane.  As requested she left me with a bruised face and she beat my belly like a drum.  Andi is a definitely a 10 out of 10.    Andi is a great lady.  Treat her with respect and you will have the best session of your life.  I&#039;ve already made plans to see her again.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I just had an awesome double session with Constance and Andi Vicious! They both looked super hot and seemed like they were having fun working together to put me in a variety of holds.  They did a lot of holds where one would have me trapped in a scissor and then the other would sit on my face. Super awesome! I would definitely book a session with them again!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Just had Round 2 with the amazing amazon, Andi Vicious! The session was figuratively AND literally breathtaking, as Andi landed multiple punches, axe kicks, and knee drops directly into my solar plexus! I loved it each time! Her striking accuracy is a testament to her level of skill and training. If you feel intimidated by this, FEAR NOT! Andi can tailor the session to you and make sure you have a safe and fun time. Andi and I are both lifelong martial artists, and she knows how much I can take! Whether you want a full-contact belly beatdown session like mine, or a fun fantasy session, you will not want the experience to end! In addition to her fit, attractive physique, Andi has a fun, energetic, and welcoming personality. I was so happy to see her again, and I am looking forward to Round 3!

					<description><![CDATA[It’s hard to even begin in what NEEDS to be said about this woman. I’m a producer out of LA so I booked her for a shoot not a session. First of all in person this woman is a statuesque, tall warrior Goddess with piercing almost intimidating eyes. However she’s so kind and welcoming. It feels like an honor to be around her and if you’re sessioning good luck.. this woman as strong as she looks in pictures has an unbelievable physique in reality. She was such a natural in her scenes shot with me and her improv and movement is incredible she uses her martial arts skills perfectly and safely and she is very easy to talk to. It didn’t feel like work at all and I couldn’t recommend her more to shoot with or session with. I seriously can’t wait til she visits again I’m always going to prioritize booking her.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I booked Andi on the recommendation of Constance (another SG model) and I was glad I did.

She’s incredibly fit and has a great attitude and easy to work with. The content I film is not scripted so being able to be improve is crucial.

She did well in those facets and was professional throughout. I recommend her for shoots and session.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I sessioned with Andi Vicious at the afterparty for the WAOnFire event on 6/17/23. Before the event started, Andi and I talked and bonded over the variety of martial arts styles that we trained in. We had a great conversation. During the event, she kicked ass in her match!

For the session itself, we did my usual favorites: HARD belly punching/elbows/knees, trampling, foot worship, and belly worship. I was Andi&#039;s personal ground and pound dummy as she got into full mount and blasted my abs with punches, elbows, and knee drops. I could definitely feel that I was getting hit by a trained fighter! It was a breathtaking session, as Andi tiptoed on my solar plexus and sunk her full weight into me. 

After putting in the hard work beating my abs, it was time for some foot and belly worship to close out the session! My favorite part of this was when we got belly to belly and felt each other&#039;s abs flex and relax. When our session ended, I introduced Andi to my good friend, MMA Aiden. The WAOnFire event was a great opportunity to meet new SessionGirls and to connect them with each other!

I am so glad that I got to meet Andi at the event and session with her. I&#039;m looking forward to Round 2!]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I sessioned with Andi Vicious at the afterparty for the WAOnFire event on 6/17/23. Before the event started, Andi and I talked and bonded over the variety of martial arts styles that we trained in. We had a great conversation. During the event, she kicked ass in her match!</p>
<p>For the session itself, we did my usual favorites: HARD belly punching/elbows/knees, trampling, foot worship, and belly worship. I was Andi&#8217;s personal ground and pound dummy as she got into full mount and blasted my abs with punches, elbows, and knee drops. I could definitely feel that I was getting hit by a trained fighter! It was a breathtaking session, as Andi tiptoed on my solar plexus and sunk her full weight into me. </p>
<p>After putting in the hard work beating my abs, it was time for some foot and belly worship to close out the session! My favorite part of this was when we got belly to belly and felt each other&#8217;s abs flex and relax. When our session ended, I introduced Andi to my good friend, MMA Aiden. The WAOnFire event was a great opportunity to meet new SessionGirls and to connect them with each other!</p>
<p>I am so glad that I got to meet Andi at the event and session with her. I&#8217;m looking forward to Round 2!</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Wow... where to even start!

Let me start by saying that from start to finish, this was an awesome experience and definitely the best session I&#039;ve had to date!

Andi was extremely professional and accommodating to everything discussed in email and at the session, she really helped get the most out our time! Speaking of time, straight up not a clock watcher and really cares about your over all experience!

We had our session in an actual dojo, and she had all the things we would need, gloves, pads, etc. Overall very very well prepared! She wore the outfit I had requested, looking like a muay thai goddess!

We started with a semi-comp Muay Thai/Kickboxing session, we did 5x 2min rounds and damn... I know she was turned down but she&#039;s got some force! She&#039;s also super technical, I got hit like 3-4 times and by the time I knew what had happened I got hit AGAIN! Really cool to experience what it&#039;s like to go against a trained fighter! After that we took a breather and we just talked about what other things I wanted in the session. It&#039;s just so nice to get that kind of meticulous attention to detail! We did some foot/muscle worship, and man... she&#039;s got a body! We then switched to a more fantasy muay thai/kickboxing session and she just toyed with me while making me worship her body. It was such an amazing experience and like I told her, only thing that could elevate an already awesome session, was had this been in a boxing ring!

Rather thankful our initial attempt at our first session didn&#039;t go through, and gave me the chance to really enjoy this one! She&#039;s a 10/10 HEAVILY RECOMMEND! If she&#039;s in your area or you&#039;re in hers, totally book her, you won&#039;t regret it!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In time in this session wrestling ecosystem I have had the opportunity and the honor to meet some truly incredible women! Women I&#039;m almost certain I would not have been able to in contact with otherwise. I&#039;m grateful to every lady that has given me the honor of sharing the mats with them. This time is no different. When I decided to work up the nerve to competitively book the physically imposing and yet stunningly gorgeous Andi Vicious I knew I had to get my Ps and Qs just to give her a good roll. Ms. Andi is not your dime of dozen fetish model but a LEGIT fighter with actual and current Ring and Cage experience. This session had an unique element of dare I say &quot;danger.&quot; Now I&#039;ll share how much I found out how legit is our star Andi.

First of all, when I made my initial inquiry she responded almost immediately! It was definitely within the hour. We originally booked for Wednesday night but the weather was absolutely horrendous. We were able to move our meet to Friday night! Her communication from the time of my first inquiry until the time we meet at the hotel was nothing short of top-notch! Even with all those accommodations, I was still late, ugh! Finally we were able to meet. I wasn&#039;t greeted with a hug, no I was greeted with a special treat. To quote her &quot;You just in time to see our girl FIGHT!&quot; Who was &quot;our girl&quot; who she was referring to... none another than the Session Wrestle Queen herself Dez Desire! I won&#039;t divulge on the outcome I will say against a girl 14 years her junior, who missed weight and then ballooned up to be MUCH heavier Ms. Dez proceeded to turn in a &#039;Fight of the Night&#039; performance! Andi and I couldn&#039;t be more proud! Okay... now down to the business portion of our evening!

We stretched and conversated about each other&#039;s martial arts experience and training. She shared that her grappling experience came from her years training for fights. By her own admission I had more formal training than she did but wasn&#039;t point of advantage for me. I trained in class; she trained/trains to fight live and game opponents. It&#039;s not the same. In any case, once we finished stretching Andi set a timer for 10 minutes to start. This would prove futile as we don&#039;t so much lose track of time as we just metaphorically said &quot;F#$&#038; it&quot; and kept up our scramble. 30 Minutes later we found ourselves in a sort of stalemate as I got in position for a Kimura lock but was trying to only twist slow. Andi conceded the submission but I know I didn&#039;t have the submission fully. So I left it as a mulligan in my mind. One mental note that I jot down and I hope another men take notice in the future is Andi natural strength. I noted to myself that &#039;this the LONGEST, STRONGEST woman I&#039;ve trained with...&#039; to date. Andi is also very adept to the ground. Very well trained! If I faced this combination of skill, awareness, flexibility, elongation and strength with any less training Andi Vicious would have lived up to that last name and would&#039;ve wiped the floor with me. But as it goes we went two more rounds. This time around we didn&#039;t even bother with the timer. This second round was in a word... EPIC! It seemed as though neither one of us going to give the other a inch of advantage. We covered every square inch of the mat and then some! She was fighting to dominate and I was fighting for my life. LOL! Finally I was able to secure a side control pin/trap combo and was able to apply and Americana. We both gave each other high fives after that round. It was pretty amazing. 

After about a 10 minute break, we started our third and final round. We didn&#039;t go as fast as the first round and definitely not as hard and fast as we did the second round. Both of us pretty exhausted from the fight we gave each other took it a little bit easy, at first. We notched it up only a little bit more once we got going. Andi with more measured but still aggressive pace and approach was able to secure a knee on belly and Ezekiel choke combo. I had no choice but tap or go home with bruised throat. I wisely chose the former. Match done! It ended in a draw for me! I was quite grateful. I went toe to toe with a currently competing MMA Fighter and didn&#039;t die. There&#039;s my win! LOL!  Andi and I shot the breeze for at least another 20 minutes afterwards! We laughed about our match, we talked about some big things that Andi maybe involved with in the future, and overall we just simply bonded. Andi is one down to earth young lady. She not just a pretty face attached to a model&#039;s body (even she is every bit of gorgeous). Andi is a business woman with plans to become a phenomenon in this industry (assuming that she&#039;s not already)! 

I truly can&#039;t find anymore positives or superlatives to describe my time with the combat extraordinaire! I highly recommend her for your next session experience! Even though this is an near insult to my actual thoughts of why if this phenom is in your neighborhood that you just book her without a FIRST thought. I figure I just go ahead a land my plane right here. A quick tip in booking her competitively, if you have the thought in your head that her attractive features and slender frame means that you&#039;re gonna have an easy match; GET IT OUT! Whatever height (if that), weight or strength &quot;advantage&quot; you think you have WILL NOT matter! If you are in any way less skilled, less talented, less experienced, if you have less technique, have less training and or less physically conditioned, etc... (And I assure most of you are.) Prepare to be submitted! The more you align yourself with this fact the better your session will go, guaranteed! Andi told me that before our session that she had a competitive session with some wrestler that was 6 foot 200+ pounds that resembled a fight! She wrangled him to a complete stalemate: 0 - 0! Long, Strong, Flexible, Fearless and Undaunted = Andi Vicious. 

I must leave you all with my final imprint. I can&#039;t help but remember that she told me that she LOVES Dragons! I forgot whether or not she a Game of Thrones fan or not. Nevertheless, I couldn&#039;t help but notice her ultra cool stuffed mystic dragon on her bed. I can definitely imagine her being one of those Warrior Queens riding a dragon into battle scorching everything that&#039;s in her way towards victory! That&#039;s how she stands to me! So while she stand physically imposing with a warrior-like physique; this beautiful Oklahoma Sweetheart will beat you down and leave you BEGGING for more! May your session experience be half as magical as me writing this review about it! Andi, the Mystical Queen of Dragons, may there be peace in your journey towards greatness! Thank you for allowing me to become another witness.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I just finished a session with Andi a couple days ago. When I picked her up from the airport, she looked like a sweet innocent young woman.  Boy was I wrong! She is the ultimate professional, prompt and intelligent. Besides all this, she has a delectably devilish look about her that makes you melt! After a few minutes of chatting, we began wrestling, her impressive strength and skills over whelmed me , despite her small stature, and to top it off , she sang cute &#039;lil songs that would frustrate you as well as LOVE at the same time! After  she destroyed me time and time again, we chatted some more while I rested and licked my wounds.  I can not wait to see her again, and you would be a FOOL not to session  with the Amazon Queen who also goes by the name Andi.  She was on a  5 point scale..........she was easily a &quot; 7&quot;]]></description>
