					<description><![CDATA[I saw Kira a couple months ago and she was without a doubt my favorite session of all time. I asked her to dominate me with her curves and to ignore my submissions whenever she wanted to! 

Boy did she listen to those requests! Her breast smothers and facesits left me seeing stars in ways I could never imagine. Combine that with the trash talk I asked her to deliver and it made it a truly exhilarating time. Trying to breathe as she tightened the hold instead of letting go when I tapped was truly terrifying in exactly the ways I wanted. 

Now that I&#039;ve done this session, the only thing I&#039;ll change next time is ask her to be even more vicious as she deprives me of air, a request I can tell she&#039;ll only be too excited to oblige. That may be the best part of being dominated by her -- knowing that she enjoys ensuring you can&#039;t breathe.

I cannot recommend enough taking the time out of your day to visit her, especially given how easy it is to communicate with her and coordinate.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Kira is probably the most genuine session girl, out there!!! So I was supposed to have a session with her in May but I had to cancel because of real life events, she totally understood my situation and even honored my deposit. I didn’t even get to session with her until two weeks later, so we communicated and we finally made the session happen. So we had a tickling and foot fetish session. I asked for a “ show no mercy” tickling session and she delivered!!! I was tied down and once she found my most ticklish spot she exploited it and did not stop tickling like I asked…. It was amazing!!!!  Let’s not forget about her feet….. if you like girls with big long narrow feet and long toes, she’s the girl for you!!! Those size 11 of hers will not disappoint. I encourage you to have a session with her!!!!]]></description>

Booking her was very easy, and after I shared my desires, she completely understood what I was looking for and made my fantasies come to life! She is also incredibly friendly and made me feel comfortable throughout the session. She is very talented and knows how to deliver on your wishes! I’ll definitely be back soon!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It’s bulking season and Kira has grown in strength, thickness and looks amazing. I’m just a couple months the transformation is unreal. I really tried my hardest and was put down with even less effort than before.

It was a great session as always and Kira is so personable and easy on the eyes I’d have enjoyed the time even if she didn’t bring her A game. Of course she always does and I had a helluva time. She remains my favorite and if you haven’t visited or been back in a while, I highly recommend that you do! She’s sweet, sadistic and sexy/strong as hell. You won’t regret it <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I had a recent session with Kira and despite having sessioned with her often over the last few years she continues to impress and improve  We did competitive wrestling and she was def at a new level Needless to say I lost but managed to win a few falls She is such a fun and entertaining woman  that the time before and after the session,  as well as between falls,  is just as enjoyable as the actual wrestling challenge she provides She is open minded regarding session formats as you can see in her wide array of offerings listed on Session Girls. IMO having sessioned with many different women in a number of different formats over the years she is guaranteed to provide you with an unforgettable experience and have you looking forward to booking her for your next session regardless of which type of session you select from her varied and diverse menu of offerings]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I just had a repeat session with by far the best mixed wrestler I&#039;ve EVER seen or experienced (I&#039;ve been to MANY). Kira&#039;s intelligence, beauty, strength, athleticism and energy are second to none. I&#039;ve gone deeper into reverence for Kira, and she&#039;s the only one that I will ever see going forward. Her body is UNBELIEVABLE. Her thighs, glutes, arms, and MIND will definitely capture you. I began to transform with her. I&#039;m going to continue to have wonderful sessions with Kira. Truly, I never had gone into &quot;sub space&quot; during a mixed wrestling session; but I&#039;m another one under Kira&#039;s control now, and it&#039;s great.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[So I had my second session with Kira, and can say the first one was not a fluke. If you haven&#039;t read my first review, definitely do. The short version is that I&#039;m 6&#039;1, 180, and a bjj black belt, and Kira still kicked my ass. I literally could not process that a girl had beaten me so thoroughly and so many times, so even though it had only been two weeks, I booked her again. I was sure I was going to win this time. I didn&#039;t. It wasn&#039;t even close. 

Before I describe the session, a few words about Kira. As I described last time, she&#039;s a frickin brick house. Like she just has freakishly good genetics for strength and athleticism. She was telling me she only recently really stepped up her lifting, so she is likely quite a bit stronger than the last time you saw her (if you&#039;ve seen her before), and only getting stronger. She also just has fighting instincts. She was telling me a little more about the fight with the boy Johnny when she was younger and the time she kicked her teacher in the balls. The detail I found interesting was that Kira was in this remedial class for all the troublemakers and bad kids. One day in that class, Kira was acting up. It was when the teacher tried to restrain her, that she back heeled him in the balls, dropping him to the floor, right in front of all the other behaviorally challenged kids. The guy was so humiliated, he actually pressed charges, lol. Point being, if you were a nerd that got beat up by a girl when you were younger, it was probably by a girl like Kira.

Moving on, round one, my strategy was to play a more aggressive take down game so I could get top control, and hopefully maintain control and get some submissions. So I engage her, trying to set up some grips, and she knees me in the balls. As I doubled over, she pushed my head down to the floor, and clamped it between her thighs. So I&#039;m face down, elbows and knees (turtle position), but with my head immobilized. Then I feel her right hand under my abdomen and her left reaching over top of my butt and between my legs, both seeking out my balls. I tried to fight off her hands with my own, and also tried falling to my side so my legs wouldn&#039;t be spread. That landed me right in a head scissor, getting my neck and skull crushed, with her still trying to pry my hands away and squeeze my balls. Inevitably, she did, and I had no choice but to panic tap. 

Overall she subbed me at least a dozen times, including two bulldog chokes, a head scissor where I almost lost consciousness, and the rest ball squeezes. There was one round I almost won. I took her down with a judo throw, and got side control. This is not a safe position against her, she will grab your balls from there. So while controlling her hands as best I could, I advanced to mount. Again still not safe, but a little better. Then she exposed her right tricep, allowing me to cinch a gift wrap and then take her back. From the seat belt grip, I took my bottom hand and controlled her right hand. Then I used my left leg to tie up her left arm. My left arm was around her throat. I can often finish that choke like that, one-handed. But not this time. So I engage both hands, sinking in the full rear naked choke (ie sleeper hold). I was careful to put it on slow and gradual. Too slow and gradual unfortunately, because before I could get her to tap, she had reached behind her back and grabbed my balls, eliciting an instant panic tap from me.

I honestly could not find any solution. I knew she was going for my balls every time and just flat out couldn&#039;t stop her. I frankly don&#039;t see how anyone could avoid that with her. She&#039;s strong af, has long arms, and is just locked in on her target. If you want to feel absolutely helpless, you will not find a better session than Kira. A+]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[As a fan who&#039;s dabbled in sessions for around 20 years now, I can say that Kira is the most fun session I&#039;ve ever had. I first sessioned with her a few years ago and always had an amazing time with her personality, natural strength and the energy she radiates, but I myself went off the scene  a couple years ago.

In the time since, Kira (who always used to beat me without much difficulty) has grown tremendously in strength. She&#039;s still the same bubbly warm personality she always was (with a sadistic side that&#039;s worth the pain-assuming the bad b* doesn&#039;t actually break you [she&#039;s capable of it but also has great control]). Considering how often she&#039;d have me tapping in our prior matches, when she revealed before this match that she&#039;d never really trained hard until this year, it reminded me of DBZ&#039;s Freeza saying he&#039;d never trained then returning with ridiculous growth after 3 months (RIP Toriyama). It&#039;s unreal!

How do I figure how much stronger she&#039;s gotten? I think 2 years ago I was able to make it almost to what she calculated was 90% of her full scissor before tapping. Here I was tapping furiously at 30% and she never broke a sweat. No disrespect to the other SG&#039;s but I have no idea who that&#039;s active could take her as she is now. At the alarming rate she&#039;s gaining strength (while still having all the beauty of the feminine frame) I think you&#039;d have to ask Arekah Lox to come out of retirement for Ms. Kira to have to go all out.

All-in-all, if you haven&#039;t sessioned with Kira, you&#039;re missing out. If you think you can beat her, you&#039;re probably mistaken. And if you need to de-stress and get rid of all the anxiety and bad energy from the world off you, Kira will beat it out of you and take great pleasure in doing it!

Thank you Ms. Kira for another memorable session. Will definitely be back soon ;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I had the pleasure of doing a session with Kira this week, and words almost can&#039;t express how impressed I am. To keep this organized, I am including headings and grades for session logistics, physicality, and personality/beauty

Logistics A+

Kira was super easy to communicate with via email, and has a fun personality that already came through in our email exchange. I always find this a big plus. To me, the excitement of the session starts with that first email response, so it kills the chemistry (for me anyway) when it&#039;s overly terse or formulaic. That was not an issue with Kira. The other great thing about the logistics is that she has a little townhouse for her sessions (with mats), which I personally found far superior to / more comfortable than a hotel. And it is in a fairly nice, safe, suburb-y area.

Physicality A+

This is the thing that most impressed me about Kira. She is remarkably gifted when it comes to strength, athleticism, and physicality - she must have freakishly good genetics. I am 6&#039;1, 180, and a bjj black belt. I train almost exclusively with guys, including young, strong athletic guys (mostly white through purple belts) and pretty easily win, almost never feeling any danger. In my bjj gym, we have a female black belt from Brazil that&#039;s an extremely accomplished competitor. But when I roll with her, it&#039;s &quot;rolling with a girl&quot;. I pretty easily win, and never feel any real danger. This was not the case with Kira. She completely dominated me. It felt like she was almost a different species. Most of our rounds were &quot;dirty&quot; wrestling, where she could do whatever she wanted, including grabbing my balls. With her freakish strength and athleticism, and long arms, I could not protect both my balls and neck at the same time, and lost probably a dozen straight rounds. I then challenged her to a clean round, and to my astonishment, she still beat me two out of three. If you&#039;re asking how she could beat a bjj black belt in clean submission wrestling, I will say, she is unorthodox (lots of looks I had never seen), and the mat space is somewhat confined, so I felt a little limited in what I could do. I suppose deep down part of me also &quot;wanted to lose&quot;, but that is always true when I do sessions and yet no session wrestler has been able to embarrass me like that. I think it&#039;s mostly down to her freakishly good genetics.

Personality A+ &#038; Beauty A

For starters, I found her to be even better looking in person than in her pics. She is a lot leaner than I expected, and she apparently spends a lot of time at the gym. Her personality is really spunky, and she definitely loves beating up guys and takes tremendous pride in it. When she found out I was a black belt, she absolutely lit up. I could tell she felt absolutely thrilled that she had man handled a black belt. I asked her when she first noticed she liked beating up guys, and she told me how in middle school she beat tf out of one boy, and how she kicked one of her teachers in the balls. If you&#039;re looking for a real life &quot;boybeater,&quot; I&#039;ve never found one quite like Kira.

In conclusion, I cannot recommend kira enough. If you have questions, shoot me a dm]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Had a wrestling session a couple of months ago with Kira, and it was a great experience! She’s very communicative and fun to talk to, and her scissors were INSANELY strong. I had absolutely no way of getting out once she got on top of me or locked her legs. Plus, she put me in an RNC for the first time which was fantastic! Definitely book a session with her, and you won’t be disappointed!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[OMG!!! I saw her for the first time back in 2017 and then I saw her again last week. She was strong before, but I was completely helpless against her this time. She is STRONG! I can&#039;t emphasize that enough, unless you are super strong, she will control you at will. I am a big strong guy, and she handled me like a kid. I could tell from her pics that she put on some muscle, but pics could not prepare me for what I was up against. She is easily the most underrated lady on the scene in my opinion. I am now inspired to get back in the gym to hopefully give her at least a little bit of a challenge the next time. Thanks for a great session, Ms Savage, I am looking forward to a rematch soon.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This lady is the best ever. When she says you will tap, cry, or beg for mercy she means it. I was submitted multiple times and each one begged for mercy and for her to release the hold. My attitude is changed and I am now a believer in Female Supremacy.]]></description>
