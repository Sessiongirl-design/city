					<description><![CDATA[I recently had a session with Vilette in the Greater Springfield, Ma. area and it was fantastic.  She has many years of experience with Session Girls and as you will notice offers a ton of different options that you can choose in your session.  Being a novice at best I chose a light fantasy type wrestling session coupled with  some tests of strength, lift and carry , scissoring, and a little face sitting.  Vilettte was great at all of this and at the same time emphasized fun and safety.   She is also a super nice woman. I enjoyed the session very much and strongly recommend Vilette for anyone looking to have a Session Girl session.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My session with vehement vilette was absolutely amazing. Starting off she was very quiÃ§k in email response and incredibly accommodating to my schedule. She usually doesn&#039;t take new clients since she&#039;s taken a break from videos and only sessioning with regular clients since the pandemic, but once my references gave glowing recommendations, she was more than happy to session with me. I asked for a headscissor domination session and that&#039;s exactly what i got. At first glance i underestimated her cause she&#039;s the size for woody from toys story but she has the strength of 7 regular sized toys <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f602.png" alt="ðŸ˜‚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />. Her squeeze was intense and her personality immediately clicked with mine so conversation and jokes are abundant during the session. She was very caring after every hold and even let me pick the hold she would k.o me in. Leading up to the k.o my favorite hold was the reverse scissor off the side of the table we were utilizing, her ass was soft yet firm when she required, the squeeze and release tactic takes the wind out if u slowly but surley and then she turns on the pressure when u least expect it to send u into a frenzy. There was a point where she had me in a straight scissor and instructed me to attempt to lift her, i did and she was suspended in mid air but remained locked in the hold in a fantastic show of core strength. On to the ko hold, i choose a straight scissor since she was very careful and had strict rules for k.o&#039;s : medical backround before hand, blood pressure, and any bodily defects and lastly she required the hold to be one where she could see my face. I choose a straight/side scissor. She was extremely detailed in the her explanation of relaxing and not fighting the pressure to allow for a more blissful passing out and it worked like a charm.  Her squeeze was tight and slowly creeping in on me as i felt my fight or flight start to kick in i remembered that i hadn&#039;t felt scared or anything during the entire session and that she had earned my trust to relax and place myself at her mercy. It was a wondeful 2 ko&#039;s back to back. A definite 10/10 session and will definitely be seeing her again.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Vilette was very comfortable to session with. She really understood what I was feeling and how to help me out and make me feel good and have fun throughout the session. I was very quiet throughout as it was my first session but she engaged me continuously to keep it lively. Session wise she looked small but she is very strong but she ensured I am not taking too much I couldnâ€™t bear. Over all I loved the session and would look forward to the next time she will be here in Minneapolis.

					<description><![CDATA[Vilette was the most caring, compassionate and most importantly fun girl I have ever I have ever had a session with. As soon as we met, she made me feel comfortable and put me at ease. She is exhilarating to talk to and exceptionally pretty. It is obvious she truly cares about her clients, and she will go above and beyond to make sure you have the time of your life. I was tickled pink after she spent time exploring my fetishes and made my fantasies a reality! She let me pick out her outfit and was very open minded with my session request. Her personality made me feel like I knew her for years and she has enthusiasm, creativity, and you can tell she truly enjoy what she does. I left speechless and in awe after our breathtaking session. I can&#039;t forget to mention she is incredibly strong, energetic and she will go beyond your wildest dreams in the session. I traveled pretty far to see her, but it was 100% worth it. It&#039;s been a couple weeks since the session now and I still get goosebumps thinking about it. Vilette is my top favorite, and I can not say enough positive things about her. Go session with her; you won&#039;t regret it!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I just finished sessioning with Vilette for the first time as she has started traveling again and it may have just been the best session experience I&#039;ve ever had.  I&#039;ve been wanting to session with her for many years after watching her videos with Safa Warda.  I&#039;m so glad I reached out to her. 

Getting in touch and setting up the session was incredibly easy.  Communication back and forth about the details of the session from the holds I liked and the outfits I preferred were a pleasant surprise.  She even sent me some pictures of outfits she had with her ahead of time to let me choose.  I could tell she really cared about making sure her clients had a good experience.

When she greeted me at the door in her outfit she looked amazing.  She&#039;s just as beautiful as she is in her pictures.

The session itself was everything I requested.  I had a knee injury coming in to the session so we couldn&#039;t tumble and roll around as much as I typically like to do, but I could tell she would have been ready to take me out.  She doesn&#039;t do fully competitive anymore, but she definitely has some skills.  I&#039;m way taller than she is and she had no problem keeping me pinned down where she wanted.  She&#039;s deceptively strong.  Her scissors were tight  and she toyed with me in them until her heart was content.  She warned me before we started that her reverse facesit was very effective.  I can now confirm: you don&#039;t breathe unless she wants you to.

If all of this was not reason enough to session with Vilette (and it is!) she&#039;s a great person to know off the mat.  I had a fun time just hanging out with her.  You can tell she really is passionate about her work and enjoys her craft.  For me that makes the session all the more enjoyable.

If you&#039;re looking for the ideal session partner on this site to do anything from fantasy style to a semi-competitive match, Vilette is your girl.  She&#039;s also very well versed in other fetishes, so if that&#039;s your thing, look her up.  I&#039;m lucky I don&#039;t live closer to Philly, otherwise I&#039;d probably be physically, mentally and financially broken.

10/10 I can&#039;t recommend her highly enough]]></description>
